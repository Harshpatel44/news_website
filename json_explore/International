      "text": "Comments Print \nThe European Commission presented on Wednesday (11 April) a proposal aimed at restoring public trust in scientific studies on food safety, suggesting more transparency in decision-making and greater involvement of member states’ experts.\nFollowing a European Citizens’ Initiative on the re-authorisation of the controversial herbicide glyphosate, the EU executive unveiled a new proposal that will be discussed with the European Parliament and member states and should be adopted by mid-2019.\nThe lack of access to scientific studies used for the authorisation of products in the name of business confidentiality has triggered strong reactions from health advocates and policymakers, who blamed the lack of transparency on chemicals industry.\nUnder the new proposal, EU citizens are granted greater access to information submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on approvals concerning the agri-food chain.\nInspired by the Monsanto Papers and in an effort to avoid companies “hiding” unfavourable studies, the executive intends to create a common European Register of commissioned studies in which all information will be submitted.\nGreece authorises Monsanto’s Roundup for five years The Greek ministry of agriculture officially approved on Tuesday (6 March) the re-authorisation of the world’s most commonly used weedkiller, Monsanto’s Roundup, which contains controversial chemical substance glyphosate.\nThe Commission pointed out, though, that confidential commercial information would not be disclosed “as long as this is duly justified”. So, the applicant should submit both a non-confidential and confidential version of the studies.\nBut in two cases confidential information will be made public: When an urgent action is essential to protect public health, animal health or the environment and when the information is part of the conclusions of an EFSA opinion and relates to foreseeable health effects.\nIn addition, the Commission’s proposal provides a better representation of member states’ experts in EFSA’s Management Board\n“Member states will also propose independent and top quality experts for EFSA Scientific Panels’ membership with a view to gathering a large pool of experts from which the best experts – meeting EFSA’s strict criteria for independence and excellence – will be selected,” the executive noted.\nFunded studies by EU taxpayers \nAnother proposal is related to the Commission’s ability to demand that EFSA request additional studies in the event of intense controversy on a case. These additional studies, according to the executive, should be financed from the EU budget.\n“However, this is without prejudice to the responsibility of applicants for providing the scientific evidence needed by EFSA for the risk assessment process.”\nThis triggered the reaction of Greenpeace, which said in a statement that the chemical industry remains in charge of testing its own products.\n“The publication of test results supporting applications for pesticide approvals is the bare minimum. But the Commission is just papering over the cracks. Pesticide producers should not be allowed to control the testing of their own products.\n“As a rule, this should be the job of the EU – not only in controversial cases – and should not be funded by taxpayers but by the companies who want their products approved,” said Greenpeace’s EU spokesperson, Mark Breddy.\nOn the other hand, the pesticides industry hailed the Commission’s proposal, saying it’s vital to improve public trust in that system.\n“As a demonstration of this [support], we recently announced a Global industry Commitment with regards to the transparency of data in studies used as part of the pesticide approval process,” said Graeme Taylor, a spokesperson for the EU pesticide industry association (ECPA).\n“Building trust in the system also requires better communication by all actors in the food chain from the presentation of the risk assessment right through to the information delivered to the consumers […] I hope that the global commitment to further transparency from our industry, and the principles enshrined in this new proposal, will be met with a similar commitment by those on the other side of the debate who produce studies arguing against the need for, or approval of, pesticides.”\nIn December 2017, Bayer became the first agri-food industry to launch a transparency website , designed to enable access to scientific data needed for the evaluation of plant protection products.\n“With this step, Bayer is taking a leadership role in driving transparency, while safeguarding the company’s confidential product composition and manufacturing process data,” Utz Klages from Bayer told EURACTIV.com.\nBayer to grant access to product safety studies to rebuild public trust German chemical firm Bayer will next week launch a transparency initiative providing EU consumers with access to the safety data of its products, aiming to restore the dwindling trust in the sector, EURACTIV.com has learnt.\nKlages noted that in March 2018, Bayer’s transparency initiative entered the next phase. “Full, in-depth, safety-related study reports can now be requested providing they are not used for commercial purpose.”\n“This Bayer initiative is an important step towards increased transparency. By sharing safety data, which was previously only shared with authorities, we hope to connect the public with our scientific community in a way that builds trust and shows our desire to further create transparency,” Klages said.\nPositions Corporate Europe Observatory’s food policy campaigner Martin Pigeon , commented:\n“Automatic and pro-active publication of previously confidential industry study data in a machine-readable format is an important first step in the right direction. So is the creation of a public register of studies to prevent industry from submitting only results favourable to their products to EFSA, as well as the substantial increase of EFSA’s budget. But the Commission’s proposal features a big caveat that means anyone wanting to quote and use the data will need to ask permission to do so from the company that has provided EFSA with this data.”\n“This creates a huge risk that industry will block any scientific scrutiny of EFSA’s assessment of their products. If scientists cannot quote this data in scientific publications there will be only a limited incentive for the scientific community to double-check EFSA’s work. The publication of much-needed independent cross-checks of industry data must not depend on the goodwill of private entities whose primary objective is to make a profit, not to protect public health and the environment.”\nThilo Bode, Executive Director of the European consumer organisation Foodwatch International , noted:\n\"The continued approval of the controversial weed killer glyphosate is exemplary of one thing: It is high time that risk assessment in the agricultural and food sectors no longer serve the interests of corporations, but rather the protection of consumers. Risk assessment must be done consistently according to the precautionary principle as laid out across European treaties”.\n“The reversal of the burden of proof must apply when it comes to assessing the safety of a product or substance: If there is scientific evidence of health hazards, no approval should be issued for precautionary reasons - and existing authorisations should be withdrawn. And: All studies, including those of the industry, must be on the table. This has not been the case, as shown in the glyphosate example so far: Even now, Monsanto keeps secret its own studies on the potential dangers of glyphosate,” he added.",

      "text": "http://str.sg/oc9z Copy \nTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday (April 11) named a key ally to head her office and lead communications efforts aimed at shoring up her wilting approval ratings in the run-up to local elections this year. \nThe appointment comes a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping urged Taiwan's business community to shun any idea of independence for the self-ruled island and promote peace and stable ties with the mainland. \nChen Chu, now the mayor of Taiwan's southern city of Kaohsiung, takes charge on April 23, as dissatisfaction with some economic policies has pushed Tsai's approval rating to its second lowest level since she took office in 2016. \n\"We very much look forward to the important role of 'Sister Chu',\" Tsai told a news conference. \n\"During the process of pushing reforms, to have sufficient communications and dialogues between the government and society is very important.\" \nTaiwan's mayoral and magisterial elections are set for Nov 24 this year. \nChen, the manager of Tsai's successful 2016 election campaign, is a colourful figure of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who has visited China twice, in 2009 and 2013. \nAs a former political prisoner at the forefront of Taiwan's struggle for democracy, Chen has not shied from irritating Beijing, but has repeatedly called for better communication with China. \nAt Wednesday's news conference, when asked about relations with China, Tsai said communication applied to \"anybody\" to balance interests and conflicts, but did not elaborate. \nBeijing claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, part of \"one China\", and has never renounced the use of force to bring under Chinese control what it considers to be a wayward province. \nChina's hostility has risen since Tsai's election, as it suspects she wants to push for formal independence, which would cross a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing. \nChen, who fills a position left vacant after Joseph Wu became foreign minister in February, met Susan Thornton, the U.S. State Department's senior diplomat for East Asia, during a trip to Washington last month. \nShe has also urged greater international support for Taiwan and welcomed the opportunity for high-level visits between the island and the United States.

      "text": "Posted by Joyce Ramirez on Apr 11th, 2018 // No Comments \nZacks Investment Research lowered shares of ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a report issued on Wednesday, April 4th. \nAccording to Zacks, “ADP is one of the world’s leading providers of HCM solutions and integrated computing solutions to vehicle dealers. The stock has outperformed the industry over the past one year. We note that ADP holds a dominant position in the payroll processing and HCM market, primarily owing to its robust product portfolio. Moreover, with WorkMarket acquisition, the company will be able to integrate its human capital management tools with WorkMarket’s contingent workers platform, thus enhancing its offerings. Nevertheless, we expect investments in new initiatives will continue to weigh on the company’s bottom-line results. Moreover, rising unemployment levels will negatively impact the company. Further, increasing competition is a major headwind.” \nSeveral other equities analysts also recently commented on ADP. Citigroup restated a neutral rating and issued a $118.00 price objective (up from $110.00) on shares of ADP in a research report on Friday, January 12th. BMO Capital Markets reduced their target price on ADP from $122.00 to $121.00 and set an outperform rating on the stock in a report on Thursday, February 1st. BidaskClub cut ADP from a hold rating to a sell rating in a report on Saturday, January 13th. Stifel Nicolaus boosted their price objective on ADP from $113.00 to $133.00 and gave the stock a hold rating in a research note on Thursday, February 1st.

      "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on President Donald Trump's response to Syria's suspected chemical attack on civilians (all times local): \n11:45 a.m. \nThe Kremlin spokesman has commented on President Donald Trump's tweet warning of an imminent missile strike on Syria by saying that Moscow doesn't engage in Twitter diplomacy. \nTrump said Wednesday that missiles \"will be coming\" in response to Syria's suspected chemical attack, adding \"Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'\" \nPresident Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in televised remarks that \"we don't participate in Twitter diplomacy.\" He added that \"we support serious approaches and keep thinking that it's important not to make any steps that could further destabilize the already fragile situation.\" \nHe says claims of a chemical attack were fabricated and \"can't serve as a pretext for any forceful actions.\" \nEarlier, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry responded to Trump on Facebook, saying missiles would destroy \"all evidence\" of the attack. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova posted that \"missiles must fly towards terrorists, not a legitimate government that has been fighting international terrorism in its territory for several years.\" \n—— \n7:10 a.m. \nAfter Russia warned the United States against military strikes in Syria, President Donald Trump says missiles \"will be coming.\" \nTrump says on Twitter Wednesday: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!'\" He adds: \"You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\" \nRussian lawmakers have warned the United States that Moscow would view an airstrike on Syria as a war crime, saying it could trigger a direct military clash. \nTrump didn't say whether he was referring to a U.S. military strike. But he has threatened military action in response to Syria's suspected chemical attack, which activists and rescuers say killed at least 40 people. The Syrian government and its ally Russia have denied that such an attack ever happened. \n—— \n12:09 a.m. \nOfficials of the Trump administration have been discussing with officials of France and Britain a possible joint military response to Syria's alleged poison gas attack. \nU.S. officials tell The Associated Press that the allies have weighed launching a military strike as early as the end of this week. \nThe White House says President Donald Trump has decided not to attend a summit in South America this week to remain in the U.S. to manage the crisis. In the past Trump has vowed to stand up to Syrian President Bashar Assad. \nTrump has suggested that he has little doubt that Syrian government forces are to blame for what he says was a chemical attack, but neither he nor other administration officials have produced hard evidence. Syria denies the accusation. \nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Defying Russian warnings against U.S. military strikes in Syria, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that missiles \"will be coming\" in response to Syria's suspected chemical attack that killed at least 40 people.\n\"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,\" Trump tweeted. \"Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!' You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\"\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, however, indicated that evidence of what happened in Saturday's suspected attack near Damascus is still being studied. At a photo-taking session during a meeting with his Dutch counterpart, Mattis was asked by a reporter whether he had seen enough evidence to blame the Syrian government.\n\"We're still assessing the intelligence, ourselves and our allies,\" Mattis said. \"We're still working on this.\"\nAsked whether the U.S. military was ready to conduct an attack in Syria if ordered, Mattis replied, \"We stand ready to provide military options if they're appropriate, as the president determines.\"\nTrump did not detail what a strike would look like, or whether these would be U.S. missiles. U.S. officials have been consulting with global allies on a possible joint military response to Syria's alleged poison gas attack. Trump canceled a foreign trip in order to manage a crisis that is testing his vow to stand up to Syrian President Bashar Assad.\nSyria's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that his threats are \"reckless\" and endanger international peace and security.\nTrump's tweet also drew a quick response from Russia's Foreign Ministry. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Facebook that \"smart\" missiles would destroy any evidence of a chemical weapons attack.\nThe term \"smart\" missile dates to the introduction decades ago of weapons with advanced guidance systems — for example, using GPS — to achieve greater precision in targeting. The term was meant to contrast with \"dumb\" bombs lacking such technology. Virtually all U.S. missiles now have advanced guidance systems.\nRussian lawmakers have warned the United States that Moscow would view an airstrike on Syria as a war crime and that it could trigger a direct military clash between the two former Cold War adversaries. Russia's ambassador to Lebanon said any missiles fired at Syria would be shot down and the launching sites targeted — a stark warning of a potential major confrontation.\nShortly after warning that missiles were coming, Trump tweeted that the U.S. \"relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War.\" Then, striking a more conciliatory tone, he said: \"There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?\"\nTrump's administration has sought to show toughness on Russia, with a series of economic and diplomatic actions, including new sanctions last week against government officials and oligarchs. Trump has largely avoided criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin by name, though he singled him out in a tweet over the weekend for supporting Assad.\nIn the past, Trump has condemned others for forecasting military plans, repeatedly blistering President Barack Obama during the 2016 election campaign. During one speech, he said, \"We must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We're sending troops. We tell them. We're sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable.\"\nThe U.S., France and Britain have been in extensive consultations about launching a military strike as early as the end of this week, U.S. officials have said. A joint military operation, possibly with France rather than the U.S. in the lead, could send a message of international unity about enforcing the prohibitions on chemical weapons and counter Syria's political and military support from Russia and Iran.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the U.S. and Britain will decide how to respond. He called for a \"strong and joint response\" to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on Saturday, which Syrian activists and rescuers say killed at least 40 people. The Syrian government denies responsibility.\nThe French president does not need parliamentary permission to launch a military operation. France is already involved in the U.S.-led coalition created in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Multiple IS terror attacks have targeted France, including one last month.\nTrump suggested Monday he had little doubt that Syrian government forces were to blame for what he said was a chemical attack, but neither he nor other administration officials have produced hard evidence. This is in contrast to an incident one year ago in which U.S. intelligence agencies had video and other evidence of certain aspects of the actual attack, which involved the use of sarin gas. Trump responded then by launching Navy cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield.\nOne official said the U.S., France and Britain were considering military options that would be more extensive than the punitive, one-day strike last April. The three countries are discussing a range of options, including preventing Assad from conducting future attacks by striking military capabilities involved in carrying out such attack, the official said.\nThat official was not authorized to speak publicly and commented only on condition of anonymity.\nMacron, asked whether France would take military action, said his country would continue discussing technical and strategic information with U.S. and British allies and \"in the coming days we will announce our decision.\" He said any action would \"target chemical weapons\" stocks. Under a 2013 agreement for which Russia was a guarantor, Syria was to have eliminated all its chemical weapons, but it has used chlorine and perhaps other chemicals since then.\nTrump spoke by phone with British Prime Minister Theresa May. A British government statement said the two agreed the attack in Syria was \"utterly reprehensible\" and the international community must respond \"to uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.\" Trump met at the White House with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who told reporters that he and Trump \"see eye to eye\" on Syria.\nQatar hosts the United States' main air operations center for the Middle East, which would coordinate any American air attack in Syria.\nA watchdog agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, announced that it would \"shortly\" send a fact-finding mission to Douma, after receiving a request from the Syrian government and its Russian backers to investigate the allegations. It was not immediately clear whether that visit might affect any U.S. or allied military action.\nThe Russian military, which has troops in Syria, said on Monday that its officers had visited the site of the alleged attack and found no evidence to back up reports of poison gas being used.",

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) comments WASHINGTON — Defying Russian warnings against U.S. military strikes in Syria, President Donald Trump said Wednesday that missiles \"will be coming\" in response to Syria's suspected chemical attack that killed at least 40 people.\n\"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,\" Trump tweeted. \"Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and 'smart!' You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\" \nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, however, indicated that evidence of what happened in Saturday's suspected attack near Damascus is still being studied. At a photo-taking session during a meeting with his Dutch counterpart, Mattis was asked by a reporter whether he had seen enough evidence to blame the Syrian government.\n\"We're still assessing the intelligence, ourselves and our allies,\" Mattis said. \"We're still working on this.\"\nAsked whether the U.S. military was ready to conduct an attack in Syria if ordered, Mattis replied, \"We stand ready to provide military options if they're appropriate, as the president determines.\"\nTrump did not detail what a strike would look like, or whether these would be U.S. missiles. U.S. officials have been consulting with global allies on a possible joint military response to Syria's alleged poison gas attack. Trump canceled a foreign trip in order to manage a crisis that is testing his vow to stand up to Syrian President Bashar Assad.\nSyria's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that his threats are \"reckless\" and endanger international peace and security.\nTrump's tweet also drew a quick response from Russia's Foreign Ministry. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Facebook that \"smart\" missiles would destroy any evidence of a chemical weapons attack.\nThe term \"smart\" missile dates to the introduction decades ago of weapons with advanced guidance systems — for example, using GPS — to achieve greater precision in targeting. The term was meant to contrast with \"dumb\" bombs lacking such technology. Virtually all U.S. missiles now have advanced guidance systems.\nRussian lawmakers have warned the United States that Moscow would view an airstrike on Syria as a war crime and that it could trigger a direct military clash between the two former Cold War adversaries. Russia's ambassador to Lebanon said any missiles fired at Syria would be shot down and the launching sites targeted — a stark warning of a potential major confrontation.\nShortly after warning that missiles were coming, Trump tweeted that the U.S. \"relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War.\" Then, striking a more conciliatory tone, he said: \"There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?\"\nTrump's administration has sought to show toughness on Russia, with a series of economic and diplomatic actions, including new sanctions last week against government officials and oligarchs. Trump has largely avoided criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin by name, though he singled him out in a tweet over the weekend for supporting Assad.\nIn the past, Trump has condemned others for forecasting military plans, repeatedly blistering President Barack Obama during the 2016 election campaign. During one speech, he said, \"We must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We're sending troops. We tell them. We're sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable.\"\nThe U.S., France and Britain have been in extensive consultations about launching a military strike as early as the end of this week, U.S. officials have said. A joint military operation, possibly with France rather than the U.S. in the lead, could send a message of international unity about enforcing the prohibitions on chemical weapons and counter Syria's political and military support from Russia and Iran.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the U.S. and Britain will decide how to respond. He called for a \"strong and joint response\" to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on Saturday, which Syrian activists and rescuers say killed at least 40 people. The Syrian government denies responsibility.\nThe French president does not need parliamentary permission to launch a military operation. France is already involved in the U.S.-led coalition created in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Multiple IS terror attacks have targeted France, including one last month.\nTrump suggested Monday he had little doubt that Syrian government forces were to blame for what he said was a chemical attack, but neither he nor other administration officials have produced hard evidence. This is in contrast to an incident one year ago in which U.S. intelligence agencies had video and other evidence of certain aspects of the actual attack, which involved the use of sarin gas. Trump responded then by launching Navy cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield.\nOne official said the U.S., France and Britain were considering military options that would be more extensive than the punitive, one-day strike last April. The three countries are discussing a range of options, including preventing Assad from conducting future attacks by striking military capabilities involved in carrying out such attack, the official said.\nThat official was not authorized to speak publicly and commented only on condition of anonymity.\nMacron, asked whether France would take military action, said his country would continue discussing technical and strategic information with U.S. and British allies and \"in the coming days we will announce our decision.\" He said any action would \"target chemical weapons\" stocks. Under a 2013 agreement for which Russia was a guarantor, Syria was to have eliminated all its chemical weapons, but it has used chlorine and perhaps other chemicals since then.\nTrump spoke by phone with British Prime Minister Theresa May. A British government statement said the two agreed the attack in Syria was \"utterly reprehensible\" and the international community must respond \"to uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.\" Trump met at the White House with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who told reporters that he and Trump \"see eye to eye\" on Syria.\nQatar hosts the United States' main air operations center for the Middle East, which would coordinate any American air attack in Syria.\nA watchdog agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, announced that it would \"shortly\" send a fact-finding mission to Douma, after receiving a request from the Syrian government and its Russian backers to investigate the allegations. It was not immediately clear whether that visit might affect any U.S. or allied military action.\nThe Russian military, which has troops in Syria, said on Monday that its officers had visited the site of the alleged attack and found no evidence to back up reports of poison gas being used.",

      "text": "Print By ROBERT BURNS and JOSH LEDERMAN and CATHERINE LUCEY - Associated Press   \nWASHINGTON (AP) - Defying Russian warnings against U.S. military strikes in Syria , President Donald Trump said Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” in response to Syria ’s suspected chemical attack that killed at least 40 people. \n“ Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria ,” Trump tweeted. “Get ready Russia , because they will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’ You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” \nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis, however, indicated that evidence of what happened in Saturday’s suspected attack near Damascus is still being studied. At a photo-taking session during a meeting with his Dutch counterpart, Mattis was asked by a reporter whether he had seen enough evidence to blame the Syrian government . \n“We’re still assessing the intelligence, ourselves and our allies,” Mattis said. “We’re still working on this.” \nAsked whether the U.S. military was ready to conduct an attack in Syria if ordered, Mattis replied, “We stand ready to provide military options if they’re appropriate, as the president determines.” \nTrump did not detail what a strike would look like, or whether these would be U.S. missiles. U.S. officials have been consulting with global allies on a possible joint military response to Syria ’s alleged poison gas attack. Trump canceled a foreign trip in order to manage a crisis that is testing his vow to stand up to Syrian President Bashar Assad. \nSyria ’s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that his threats are “reckless” and endanger international peace and security. \nTrump ’s tweet also drew a quick response from Russia ’s Foreign Ministry. Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Facebook that “smart” missiles would destroy any evidence of a chemical weapons attack. \nThe term “smart” missile dates to the introduction decades ago of weapons with advanced guidance systems - for example, using GPS - to achieve greater precision in targeting. The term was meant to contrast with “dumb” bombs lacking such technology. Virtually all U.S. missiles now have advanced guidance systems. \nRussian lawmakers have warned the United States that Moscow would view an airstrike on Syria as a war crime and that it could trigger a direct military clash between the two former Cold War adversaries. Russia ’s ambassador to Lebanon said any missiles fired at Syria would be shot down and the launching sites targeted - a stark warning of a potential major confrontation. \nShortly after warning that missiles were coming, Trump tweeted that the U.S. “relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War.” Then, striking a more conciliatory tone, he said: “There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?” \nTrump ’s administration has sought to show toughness on Russia , with a series of economic and diplomatic actions, including new sanctions last week against government officials and oligarchs. Trump has largely avoided criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin by name, though he singled him out in a tweet over the weekend for supporting Assad. \nIn the past, Trump has condemned others for forecasting military plans, repeatedly blistering President Barack Obama during the 2016 election campaign. During one speech, he said, “We must as a nation be more unpredictable. We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We’re sending troops. We tell them. We’re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable.” \nThe U.S., France and Britain have been in extensive consultations about launching a military strike as early as the end of this week, U.S. officials have said. A joint military operation, possibly with France rather than the U.S. in the lead, could send a message of international unity about enforcing the prohibitions on chemical weapons and counter Syria ’s political and military support from Russia and Iran. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said his nation, the U.S. and Britain will decide how to respond. He called for a “strong and joint response” to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on Saturday, which Syrian activists and rescuers say killed at least 40 people. The Syrian government denies responsibility. \nThe French president does not need parliamentary permission to launch a military operation. France is already involved in the U.S.-led coalition created in 2014 to fight the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. Multiple IS terror attacks have targeted France, including one last month. \nTrump suggested Monday he had little doubt that Syrian government forces were to blame for what he said was a chemical attack, but neither he nor other administration officials have produced hard evidence. This is in contrast to an incident one year ago in which U.S. intelligence agencies had video and other evidence of certain aspects of the actual attack, which involved the use of sarin gas. Trump responded then by launching Navy cruise missiles at a Syrian airfield. \nOne official said the U.S., France and Britain were considering military options that would be more extensive than the punitive, one-day strike last April. The three countries are discussing a range of options, including preventing Assad from conducting future attacks by striking military capabilities involved in carrying out such attack, the official said. \nThat official was not authorized to speak publicly and commented only on condition of anonymity. \nMacron, asked whether France would take military action, said his country would continue discussing technical and strategic information with U.S. and British allies and “in the coming days we will announce our decision.” He said any action would “target chemical weapons” stocks. Under a 2013 agreement for which Russia was a guarantor, Syria was to have eliminated all its chemical weapons, but it has used chlorine and perhaps other chemicals since then. \nTrump spoke by phone with British Prime Minister Theresa May. A British government statement said the two agreed the attack in Syria was “utterly reprehensible” and the international community must respond “to uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.” Trump met at the White House with the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who told reporters that he and Trump “see eye to eye” on Syria . \nQatar hosts the United States’ main air operations center for the Middle East, which would coordinate any American air attack in Syria . \nA watchdog agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, announced that it would “shortly” send a fact-finding mission to Douma, after receiving a request from the Syrian government and its Russian backers to investigate the allegations. It was not immediately clear whether that visit might affect any U.S. or allied military action. \nThe Russian military, which has troops in Syria , said on Monday that its officers had visited the site of the alleged attack and found no evidence to back up reports of poison gas being used. \n  The  ",

To me it was yet another line to stand in on either end of the trip...one to check it, one to pick it up..plus another risk of lost luggage.\nHowever, with the run on bin spaces it seems I don't have to worry about that anymore, and I am in less of a hurry than I used to be anyhow. In my really intense traveling days, when I was flying twice a week for years, my whole obsession was trying to make each journey amazingly efficient. Now, I really have no issue spending an extra 10 mins here and there if it means I don't have to wheel my luggage around and jockey for bin space.\nThe exception of course, it International travel with multiple connections. I have been stuck abroad with missing luggage one too many times I have also started to check my bag more and more for the same reasons. I do a shuttle from PDX to SEA pretty regularly and even though it is a quick flight, and many of my planes are props with plane-side baggage, I still check it. I just like being free of the bag, plus i get a chance to get my 2500 miles if Alaska takes too long",

      "title": "Paul Ryan's fiscal legacy is like no other's",
      "text": "When it comes to fiscal legacies, no speaker of the House has a record even approaching that of Paul Ryan, the gentleman from Janesville, Wis.\nThere are three major accomplishments that Ryan’s speakership, and before that his stewardship of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Budget Committee, will be remembered for.\nThe first is the most recent. In large measure due to his dogged leadership over many years, Congress passed and President Trump signed the first major tax reform in three decades. The law cut the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent (the highest in the developed world) to 21 percent (ahead of major trade competitors Japan, Mexico, Canada, Germany, and France). It moved us toward full expensing of business capital purchases, which many economists think is as important as a rate cut. It adopted a modified form of territoriality, allowing U.S. companies to avoid international double taxation without trapping earnings overseas. It lowered the top tax rate on small and family owned businesses from nearly 40 percent to less than 30 percent.\nIt cut taxes for middle class families by doubling the standard deduction, doubling the child tax credit, and lowering rates. It simplified the tax code for millions of families by making the standard deduction more attractive than the hodgepodge of itemized deductions they were formerly forced to add up.\nAs a result, the Congressional Budget Office just this week projected that America will enjoy the fastest economic growth since before the Great Recession, passing the 3 percent real GDP growth barrier in 2018. Job creation has been strong, as unemployment is projected to dip under 4 percent. Last year’s tax cut-driven run up in stocks padded the nest eggs of every family with a 401(k), IRA, or 529 education savings plan.\nThis tax relief record alone would be enough for most. But Ryan has an equally impressive resume on the spending side.\nWorking with Speaker John Boehner, Ryan, as chairman of the House Budget Committee, helped craft and then enact the Budget Control Act of 2011. Over the objections of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and President Obama, this law resulted in the largest discretionary spending reduction since the end of World War II. Discretionary spending — what Congress spends money on every year, separate and apart from entitlements and interest on the national debt — declined from 9.1 percent of GDP in 2010, the last pre-Boehner/Ryan year, to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2018, Speaker Ryan’s last year in office. That’s the equivalent of more than $500 billion per year in spending (in today’s dollars) that was wrung out of the federal leviathan. The bipartisan budget deal from this past spring locked in these gains, despite all the hair pulling at the time from the conservative commentariat.\nThe third and final major fiscal legacy of Speaker Ryan has to do with bringing federal entitlement policy from the 19th century to the 21st century. Unfortunately, this is one area where Ryan’s legacy points toward victory rather than reflects upon it. For years, Budget Committee Chairman Ryan wrote and Congress passed budgets which would have authorized major entitlement reforms and budget balance. In Medicare, they called for premium support as the missing piece of Medicare Advantage. In Medicaid, they called for states to take a greater role with limited federal support. In Obamacare, they called for repeal and replace. And in Social Security, they called for greater personal control and a transition to a system that looks more like your IRA than your grandfather’s industrial pension. Had any of these reforms become law — and the House passed both Obamacare and Medicaid reform last year, only to see it scuttled by a few myopic Republican senators — this, too, would be a major enacted policy accomplishment of the Ryan era.\nBut as the CBO points out in their long-term budget report, the entitlement crisis is not going away. The major entitlement programs — Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Obamacare — took up only 7 percent of GDP in 2000. Today, that number is nearly 11 percentage points. By 2047, it will be nearly 16 percentage points. We’ve already lost so much time. The longer we wait, the more painful it will be to get these entitlement programs under control. The longer we wait, the more current seniors will have to face some of the cuts. Ryan understood this, which explains why this was such an urgent priority of his public career.\nGoing forward, Ryan leaves his country a more prosperity-friendly federal government than the one he inherited. We have a tax code that tells the world that America is in business again and that middle class families won’t be the Beltway’s piggybank. He helped reverse the tide of the “war and stimulus” fiscal policies of the late Bush and Obama eras. And he very nearly enacted full-scale entitlement reform — and whoever does that will have Ryan to thank.\nRyan Ellis ( @RyanLEllis ) is tax policy director for the Conservative Reform Network.",

The company also identifies additional product and service opportunities for its current and future customers to expand its portfolio. Cintas has a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity to meet its working capital requirements. Cintas has outperformed the industry on an average in the last three months.

      "text": "Posted by Rob Logan on Apr 11th, 2018 // No Comments \nAbiomed (NASDAQ:ABMD) was upgraded by Zacks Investment Research from a “hold” rating to a “strong-buy” rating in a research report issued on Tuesday, April 3rd. The firm presently has a $335.00 price target on the medical equipment provider’s stock. Zacks Investment Research ‘s price target indicates a potential upside of 11.92% from the company’s previous close. \nAccording to Zacks, “Abiomed has outperformed its industry in a year’s time. The company's robust demand for the Impella product line has been the key growth catalyst. The company also received the FDA pre-market approval (PMA) for its Impella CP heart pump with SmartAssistTM, utilizing an optical sensor. Notably, Abiomed has already received CE marking approval in the European Union to market Impella CP with SmartAssist. Abiomed’s expanding product portfolio is likely to improve penetration into the prophylactic high-risk PCI and cardiogenic shock patient market. This is evident from the fact that Impella 2.5 and CP continue to add centers in the United States. However, intense competition in the niche markets is likely to mar prospects over the long haul. Abiomed’s significant international presence exposes it to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The company is likely to face increasing pricing pressure in the days to come. “ \nABMD has been the subject of several other research reports.

Josh LedermanVerified account@joshledermanAPMOSCOW (AP) - #Russia says missiles that Trump promises to send to #Syria would destroy evidence of suspected chemical weapons attackRussia has been saying that there was no chemical weapons attack.Now, they say Trump would destroy the evidence.Now they send their troops to the Douma site to keep American special forces from entering the site to test it.My goodness. Russians are hiding something serious. Re: Russia says Trump's missiles would destroy any evidence of a chemical weapons attack. We all know the chemical attack is totally fake and staged.if it happened, terrorists did it.if it didn't happen, it's another carefully staged hoax.literally zero proof Assad did anything. literally nothing in Assad's \"MO\" suggests he would do it to begin with. Enough. This benefits ISRAEL and the Knesset. Trump needs to throw AiPAC out of the US, and every single member of his cabinet and administration with dual citizenship OR significant financial ties to AiPAC or Israel needs to be ousted! Including Jared Kushner. NO MORE. Syria withdrawal HAS to happen, the southern border wall built, and MUELLER fired. SHOW SOME STEEL TRUMP, THIS IS WHY WE ELECTED YOU!!ALL HAIL HIS GRACE, DONALD OF HOUSE TRUMP, Keeper of the Borders, Father of the Walls, Deporter of illegals, Usurper of Prime Real Estate, Master of the Deal, Haver of the Best Words, Defiler of Miss Universes, Slayer of Cucks, Overlord of the Kingdoms of North America and Europe, God of Gods, King of Kings, Leader of the Human Species, Lord of the European Race and President of the Realm. Re: Russia says Trump's missiles would destroy any evidence of a chemical weapons attack. We all know the chemical attack is totally fake and staged.if it happened, terrorists did it.if it didn't happen, it's another carefully staged hoax.literally zero proof Assad did anything. literally nothing in Assad's \"MO\" suggests he would do it to begin with. Quoting: Mike_Grimmel 1) Russia will not allow inspectors to the site.2) Russia said it did not happen at all.3) Russia said that if Trump launches missiles he'll destroy the evidence.4) Russia is sending troops to the area to prevent US special forces from landing there to test the area during the upcoming attack.Russia did it. It's obvious.Why would Russia do it? We'll simple.1) Last week China reaffirmed their alliance with Russia in a military fight against the USA. This emboldens Putin. 2) Putin is betting Trump will not respond because he can't get tangles with Russia/China/Iran 3) If Trump doesn't attack it'll cause political turmoil because it'll be \"proof\" that he's controlled by Putin. 4) Russia has plausible deniability because RT/Sputnik will run articles saying \"Why would Assad gas his own people right after Trump said he's pulling out and he's winning\". There is no better time for them to do this. 5) If Trump doesn't attack after drawing a red line he loses credibility on the international stage and Russia can say Trump didn't attack because he's scared of Russian power and that'll gain them more influence/allies in the Middle East.Also, remember that Russia set the narrative on this a few weeks ago when they released through their propaganda outlets that the rebels were planning a false flag chemical attack to blame Assad. They set this up from weeks ago. They're the ones who ordered it so they knew it was coming. BELIEVE PRESIDENT TRUMP OVER PUTI N Last Edited by OutdoorsMan on 04/11/2018 11:32 AM Anonymous Coward",

      "text": "The Pentagon directed questions on President Trump’s promise to aim “nice and new and ‘smart’” missiles at Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces back to the White House, refusing to comment on potential future actions.\nTrump started his day with a salvo of tweets directed at Russia after reports emerged from the country that the Kremlin would order all missiles fired by the U.S. at Syrian government forces to be shot down.\nIn his Twitter barrage, Trump said, “Get ready Russia, because (missiles) will be coming, nice and new and ‘smart!’”\nWhen asked about the president’s statement, a Pentagon spokeswoman demurred.\n“The department does not comment on potential future military actions. I refer you to the White House to characterize the president's tweet,” said Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Rebarich.\n“As the president noted on April 8, the chemical weapons attack by the Syrian regime against innocent civilians in Duma, Syria on April 7 was horrifying, and demands an immediate response from the international community.\"\nThe threat to rain down missiles on Syria is a direct contrast to Trump’s promise not to tell America’s enemies what he’s planning on doing militarily. He frequently criticized former President Barack Obama for his administration making their war plans publicly known.\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis simply said the military was ready to act when asked about a possible retaliatory strike.\n“We stand ready to provide military options if they are appropriate as the president determined,” he said.\nMattis did not answer a question on whether he's concerned Trump is telegraphing the country's military moves.\nThe Pentagon has often been put in an awkward position by the president’s statements.\nEarlier this month, Defense Department officials were caught off-guard when Trump said the U.S. would be leaving Syria “very soon.”\nAnother Trump tweet sent off a monthslong policymaking endeavor in the Pentagon when the president ordered the military to stop accepting transgender people into their ranks. At the time, the Pentagon reportedly had no advance warning the tweet was coming and it took until March for Pentagon officials to come up with a formal policy.\nTrump’s desires for a military parade and a “space force” also caught the Pentagon by surprise after Trump mused about them in public. With both ideas, the Pentagon initially referred comment back to the White House to get the proper read on the president’s meaning.",

      "text": " CHARISMATIC Israeli high school teacher Matan Yair found more than personal satisfaction when he taught history and literature to troublesome students who had been rejected from the regular school system.\nIt sparked an idea for a movie that stemmed from the special relationship he formed with one of his teenage students.\nYair, 41, who made the documentary film It is Written in Your ID that I am Your Father in 2008, and published his first novel in 2009, graduated from the screenwriting program at the Sam Spiegel Film and Television School in Jerusalem and the MFA directing program at Tel Aviv University.\nYair wrote a script outline about his class and 17-year-old student Asher Lax and pitched it to Israeli producer Gal Greenspan, with the suggestion that Yair also direct and star as himself in the movie.\nGreenspan, CEO and co-founder of Green Productions based in Givatayim near Tel Aviv, was immediately excited about a movie based on Asher’s relationship with his charismatic teacher and his dominant father who wanted him to take over the family scaffolding business.\n“It was just over two years ago that Matan came to me and showed me a clip that he had filmed with Asher,” Greenspan told The AJN.\n“Right away I thought it looked amazing and powerful and would make a film for the big screen.”\nWas Asher the first choice for the role, even though he had no acting experience?\n“We had auditions with actors, but we knew right away that Asher was perfect for the role,” said Greenspan. “And he thought it would be a good challenge for him.”\nAnd casting the teacher’s role?\n“Matan wanted to play the teacher in the film, but we thought it was more important for him to direct the film,” said Greenspan.\nIsraeli actor Ami Smolarchik was offered the role of the teacher.\nYair spent three months writing the script based on Asher’s real-life story, and soon afterwards it was pitched at the 2016 Jerusalem Film Festival.\n“We won the first prize at the pitching session and four months later we started filming,” said Greenspan.\nGreenspan also faced another challenge – Asher would start his army service when he turned 18, so he only had six or seven months to produce the film.\n“Usually it takes quite a few years to produce a film, so it was a big challenge,” he said.\nWith Yair directing his debut feature film – titled Scaffolding – shooting took place over 16 days during school holidays.\nSet in a small city outside Tel Aviv, Scaffolding centres on the gifted but troubled student Asher (Lax), who spends his days hanging out and ignoring his education.\nAt home, Asher’s single father Milo (Yaacov Cohen) pressures him to take over his scaffolding business.\nWhen charismatic teacher Rami (Ami Smolarchik) arrives, Asher is inspired to rethink what he wants to do with his life.\nSix months after filming was completed, Scaffolding premiered at the Cannes Film Festival to acclaim and then screened at the 2017 Jerusalem Film Festival where it took out the top awards for best feature film and best actor (Asher Lax).\nAnd at Israel’s 2017 Ophir Awards (the Israeli Oscars) it won best supporting actor for Smolarchik.\nMelbourne movie fans saw Scaffolding at last year’s Jewish International Film Festival, and the film opened at the Classic Cinemas and ACMI Cinemas in Melbourne on April 5.\nGreenspan’s Green Productions was a co-producer on the Yiddish film Menashe, centred around a Brooklyn Chassidic single father Menashe trying to raise his son.\n“Menashe and Scaffolding have a lot of similarities with the main actors playing themselves and telling their own stories,” he said.\n“Both films are part-documentary and part-fiction in order to tell a true story with dramatic licence.”\nLast year Greenspan and his Australian wife Kate settled in Melbourne with plans to establish a foothold in Australia making feature films.\nScaffolding is screening at the Classic Cinemas, Elsternwick and ACMI Cinemas, Federation Square.

      "text": "Home > News > World Grain News USGC report shows good U.S. corn export, harvest quality April 11, 2018 - by Holly Demaree-Saddler Share This: Search for similar articles by keyword: [ USGC ], [ Corn ], [ United States ], [ Exports ] WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S. — The quality of corn assembled for export early in the 2017-18 marketing year was better or equal to U.S. No. 2 on all grade factors, based on the information aggregated and reported in the U.S. Grains Council’s (USGC’s) Corn Export Cargo Quality Report . “An advanced infrastructure system and robust inspection and grading standards bolster the United States’ reputation as the world’s largest and most reliable supplier of corn,” wrote Deb Keller, chairman of the USGC, in the report’s greeting. “However, members of the U.S. corn marketing system also understand the importance of consistent quality to food and feed end-users.” Average test weight found by the analysis was the same as 2016-17, indicating overall good quality. Chemical composition attributes indicated similar protein, lower starch and higher oil concentrations than 2016-17. The early 2017-18 corn exports had larger kernels and higher stress cracks, true density and horneous endosperm, but lower whole kernels than the prior year. Importantly, all of the samples for aflatoxin and deoxynivalenol (DON) or vomitoxin were below the U.S. Food and Drug Administration action and advisory levels, respectively. The export cargo quality report is based on 430 yellow commodity corn samples collected from corn export shipments undergoing the federal inspection and grading processes at export terminals. The report is a companion to another analysis, the 2017-18 Corn Harvest Quality Report , which provided information about the quality of the most recent U.S. corn crop at harvest as it entered international merchandising channels. According to the USGC, the two reports together provide reliable information on U.S. corn quality from the farm to the customer based on transparent and consistent methodology. These reports provide an early look at the grade factors established by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), moisture content and additional quality characteristics not reported elsewhere. Examining both reports is important to identify and understand any noticeable changes occurring between these two time periods. The USGC will roll out the new report’s results during a series of crop quality seminars around the world, beginning in the next two weeks in Mexico. These outreach activities help to establish clear expectations with buyers and end-users regarding the quality of corn this marketing year in addition to providing information on grading, handling and how U.S. corn is moved and controlled through export channels. “The council is committed to continuous export expansion based on the principles of mutual economic benefit and increased food security through trade,” Keller said. “Our global staff serves as a trusted bridge between international corn buyers and the world’s largest and most sophisticated agricultural production and export system.”",

There are no laces to adjust the fit, so when a loafer doesn't fit just right, there is precious little you can do to adjust it.\nIn my personal experience, I bought a nice pair of suede loafers from Herring shoes. They didn't exactly fit, but international shipping made me say... yeah, I'll keep them. So I had to put tongue pads in, which made them wearable but is less than ideal, and the fit doesn't really compare to lesser loafers (Ecco) that I bought in person. My other two pairs of Herring shoes were the same size, and by adjusting the laces or strap (jodpurs) they are extremely comfortable.",

      "text": "Apr 11, 2018 @ 11:31 AM A Festival Fashion Brand Designer Talks Inspiration And Balancing Her Business With Her Job At KPMG Share to email I believe in good food, good wine and good music Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Get Yourself Dressed Get Yourself Dressed officially launched in 2017. Courtesy of Get Yourself Dressed. Music festival season is here and some of the upcoming large festivals—such as Coachella , Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas and Burning Man —are guaranteed to be full of fun, innovative and creative costumes. \nIf you’re still trying to plan your outfit, Australian festival fashion brand Get Yourself Dressed is now shipping its playful designs to the United States. \nThe independent custom label prides itself on producing fashionable yet comfortable festival wear, with options including playsuits, hot pants, onesies and fanny packs. The concept was founded by Emma Baker in 2013 after she attended Rainbow Serpent Festival and was inspired by the outfits she saw. \n“ I was enchanted by the brightness, the color and the fun that the crowd was having,” she says. “It made my head just pop seeing all these different styles. My brain kicked into gear, and so I started working out how to construct and make these amazing creations.” Get Yourself Dressed Emma Baker's festival essentials are a fanny pack, her DSLR camera and her friends. Courtesy of Get Yourself Dressed. Get Yourself Dressed Emma Baker is working on launching an activewear business called GYD Active. Courtesy of Get Yourself Dressed. \nBaker began designing outfits for her friends, and as demand grew, she officially launched Get Yourself Dressed in 2017. She says her groovy designs are inspired by Australia’s peacock spider. \n“ The intensity of the colors on their backs is amazing and just too good to be true. It’s amazing how nature has this way of creating these colors, which are near impossible to replicate even with all the technology in the world,” she notes. “Anything that clashes or mish mashs brilliant colors all thrown together gets me every time.” \nBaker has a history in design: She studied fashion in high school and made clothing for her friends in college while pursuing her business degree. She then went on to study fashion design at RMIT University in Melbourne for one year. She says she decided to expand her sales outside of Australia and New Zealand because the United States has a large and internationally acclaimed festival market. She notes that sales have increased in the United States and the United Kingdom. Get Yourself Dressed Emma Baker's top three music festivals are Rainbow Serpent Festival, Exit Festival and Glastonbury Festival. Courtesy of Get Yourself Dressed. \nWhen Baker isn’t creating playful festival attire, she’s working as an associate director in human resources at KPMG. She manages to balance her full-time job with her fashion brand by working after hours, “ squeezing in tasks” when possible and utilizing KPMG's flexible work hours—she’s able to leave work early on Friday to set up a sales stand at a music festival and then work remotely the following Monday to get settled. \nShe adds that she used her skills from KPMG to launch Get Yourself Dressed. \n“I don’t think I would have ever had the confidence to do this without the skills I’ve learned from KPMG,” Baker notes. “Being a management consultant is about project management and multitasking, as well as meeting deadlines and getting things done. This is exactly what it takes to start a business, especially when you are juggling another day job at the same time.” Get Yourself Dressed Emma Baker's tips for making a creative outfit include \"more is more\" and putting your own unique spin on a design. Courtesy of Get Yourself Dressed. \nAlthough it can be challenging to manage a business with a full-time job, Baker has been able to successfully combine her love of fashion and music festivals with her business skills. \n“Starting a business is never easy, and there have been so many times that I get cold feet and think, ‘What have I done? I could have had a nice holiday or made a small down payment on my house loan with the money and time I have put into Get Yourself Dressed,’” Baker says. “I know, though, that this was the right thing for me to do, no matter how successful I am at the end of the day. I love creating things even if it is potentially at my own cost. Seeing how happy people are when they wear my outfits makes it all totally worth it.” Share to email",
