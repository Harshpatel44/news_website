The intention is to keep them suitable for public display at a funeral, for religious reasons, or for medical and scientific purposes such as their use as anatomical specimens. [1] The three goals of embalming are sanitization, presentation and preservation (or restoration). Embalming has a very long and cross-cultural history, with many cultures giving the embalming processes a greater religious meaning.

      "text": "» Tollywood actress Tollywood actress’ war against casting couch gets bigger; she accuses top producer’s son of rape Suhas Yellapantula This is the first time she has taken the name of someone from one of the prominent film families of Tollywood | TNN | Apr 11, 2018, 17:58 IST A Telugu actress, who has been protesting vigorously against the casting couch menace in Tollywood, is threatening to expose the big fish of the film industry now. Sharing intimate pictures of herself with a famous Telugu producer’s son, the actress, whose semi-nude protest shook the country, has now accused him of sexually harassing her and says that “he literally raped me in the studio”. “We met at a pub one day and became acquainted with each other. He then started taking me out on coffee dates and said that he was in love with me. He would often tell me that he would introduce me to big directors and producers. As an actor looking for work, I went along with him. One day, he took me inside his studio telling me that ‘the view from inside is nice’. And then he raped me, without my consent,” alleges the actress. The alleged incident took place five years ago, she says, adding that she is only speaking about it now because “I don’t want other women to suffer the same plight”. “This issue is much bigger than me. I am speaking up now today because he is a habitual offender and has sexually harassed many other women, including a transgender, using his big production house as an excuse. I’m speaking up now so that he can be punished and no other woman suffers the same plight,” she reasons. But why isn’t she filing a police complaint? “My focus is on my protest. I don’t want to run after cops, lawyers and court cases at this point...” she claims. Earlier, the actress had revealed that an Indian idol winner had propositioned her on numerous occasions and kept asking her to send him her nude pictures. The actress even shared screenshots of her conversation with the singer on WhatsApp, where he is requesting her to send him pictures. She also took the name of a top director and stated that he too was involved. However, this is the first time she has taken the name of someone from one of the prominent film families of Tollywood. when asked what he has to say about the actress’ claims, the producer’s son told Hyderabad Times, “...I am driving, I cannot talk now. Can you message me.” Repeated messages and calls to him later, went unanswered. The nature of the actress’ protest meanwhile, has left the film industry divided, with many claiming that it is not right for her to strip down in protest or claim to ‘expose’ people randomly without filing an FIR. With the issue getting bigger by the day, it remains to be seen if the bigwigs of the Telugu film industry or the Telangana government will break their silence.

The Collective, made up on women technicians and actors from Malayalam cinema, had requested that a commission should study the problems faced by women in the industry including gender discrimation, and submit a report.

Quiz him if he finds it difficult to pitch his ideas to producers and studios and the filmmaker says, “I have stopped selling the concept of my films to producers since the last few outings; I go ahead and make the film on my own. No one had a clue about what I was doing with ‘Piku’ (starring Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan and Irrfan ), they just had a basic idea. I showed the film to people only after shooting it. If someone interferes with my work, I pull out of it and I don’t associate with them. I believe that if someone does not have any respect for my work or they don’t trust what I will do with it, there is no point trying to sell them an idea. During ‘Pink’, I was so angry that I went to Ronnie (Lahiri), who has produced all my films and told him that I will make this at any cost, so decide how you want to do it.

Today, the makers announced the cast of SOTY 2 and we are excited. \n2 new faces have made a debut in the film, Tara Sutaria and Ananya Panday. We have heard Ananya’s name since she is associated with Chunkey Panday, but Tara Sutaria has grabbed a lot of eyeballs. \nWho is she? Don’t you want to know? Well, Tara has been into acting right from the time she was a child. Yes, you heard it right. When Tara was 7, she started taking part in various professional competitions and operas. \nAt the age of 13, Tara took part in “Entertainment Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega” on Sony which had Anu Malik and Farah Khan as the judges. \nLooks as if Tara is multi-talented. She is an excellent sketcher as well. Now that we know so much about her, we can’t wait to see her on big screen. \nShe looks gorgeous and probably, she will be your new crush after seeing these 10 pics. #1",

PTI | Updated: Apr 11, 2018, 16:59 IST A protester burns a Chennai Super Kings jersey during an agitation to demand the formation of the Cauvery Management Board CHENNAI: IPL organisers could find themselves on a slithery wicket with a Tamil outfit on Wednesday threatening to let loose snakes into the Chepauk Stadium in Chennai to protest over the Cauvery issue if another match of the cricket league is held at the venue. The snakes will not be poisonous as the intention is not to harm anybody, but to only express angst over the delay in formation of the Cauvery Management Board (CMB), Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK) chief T Velmurugan said. \"If the IPL match is held on April 20 in Chennai as per schedule, I will hold the snake protest. I will let snakes into the stadium. There is no change in it,\" he said. The TVK chief, who has held protests on several pro-Tamil issues, said, \"These snakes which we intend to let into the stadium will have absolutely no poison.\" \"Our idea is not to harm anybody, be it players, spectators or the police personnel on duty. We want to scare people away, let there be no cricket match now,\" he told . He said when the entire state of Tamil Nadu was on an agitation mode for its rights on the Cauvery issue, an IPL fixture, which was an entertainment event, was not needed. Seven matches, including the one held yesterday, were scheduled to be played in Chennai. IPL orgnaisers have sought additional security in the wake of the protest by various Tamil outfits, who have demanded that the matches be shifted.

After Secret Superstar and Bajrangi Bhaijaan this is the third Bollywood film which has released in China in 2018. Talking about film’s success in producer Bhushan Kumar said, “Whether it is the success of ‘Hindi Medium’ in China or ‘Raid’ doing such phenomenal business here, it only reinforces our belief that a good story is what connects with the audience. For us, the key decisions have been to pick stories that have a universal appeal. These are the fruits of those decisions and we are overwhelmed.” Hindi Medium has now crossed the Rs 260 crore mark at the global box office. ( Also Read: Hindi Medium shatters Dangal and Bajrangi Bhaijaan BUT fails to beat Secret Superstar’s first weekend collections in China ) \nApart from the lead cast, the film also stars Sada Qamar, Deepak Dobriyal, Dishita Sehgal, Tillotama Shome and Amrita Singh in pivotal roles. Hindi Medium is directed by Saket Chaudhary, who previously helmed films like Shaadi Ke Side Effects and Pyaar Ke Side Effects. Before the release, when Saket was that whether Hindi Medium will be able to do better business than Aamir’s films? He replied, “I think all of us owe Aamir Khan for showing an initiative and vision in taking Hindi cinema to a new and large audience. Without ‘Dangal’, the Chinese audience may not have been familiar with the new Hindi cinema emerging here that blends entertainment with strong social themes.”  45 pm | Updated: April 11, 2018 10:29 pm Topics:",

      "text": "Anita Hassanandani: It makes you nervous when you are stepping into a show like Naagin Anita Hassanandani shares the response she has got for Ekta Kapoor's Naagin 3 By Sreejeeta Sen |  43 pm comments \nAnita Hassanandani is currently on a roll. She has been a part of Yeh Hai Mohabbatein for the past five years and has now joined one of Balaji Telefilms’ successful franchise, Naagin. With that, she is also starring in ALT Balaji’s web rom-com, Galti Se Mistech , opposite Rithvik Dhanjani . Just a couple of days ago, TV czarina Ekta Kapoor shared Karishma Tanna’s picture as the first Naagin of Naagin 3 and today she has revealed Anita’s sultry look. Anita also shared another picture showing off her midriff and that has left us completely floored. \nWhile speaking about the response she has received so far to an entertainment portal, Anita said, “It’s very exciting and nice. I’m very thrilled. At the same time, I’m a little jittery and nervous also. With so much happening, you don’t want to make a single mistake, you want it to go better from there on.” She further added, “Absolutely, for the look mainly as even in Ye Hai Mohabbatein, my look has been always been spoken about. So, I had to look completely different from what I do, in Naagin. Ekta and I came to the understanding that let’s do tan makeup which will make me look more sensual and different from whatever I have done.” \nThe actress also shared that she had a complete say about the overall look and feel of the character. “I’m always interfering. I always have my little bit to give in because I want the best for the show and for myself. I truly believe that the way you know yourself and what will look really good on you, nobody else can understand it. I always say fine! Whatever you’ll want you’ll do but give me a chance in trying to what I feel will look the best,” revealed Anita. (Also Read: Anita Hassanandani reveals her sultry look for Naagin 3, asks fans for blessings and ‘vishes ‘) \nSpeaking about her character, she said, “I don’t think there’s really negative… it’s a revenge angle and it is properly justified. I feel even over here, my character as Vish is completely justified. I’m sure it will be layered and I’ve been shooting for it, it’s pretty difficult. It is not a very easy part to play because this character is extremely layered.” \nThe previous two seasons featured Mouni Roy and Adaa Khan, who created an impact, so it is a given that Anita might face the pressure of comparisons. While speaking about it, she said, “Not really because I always start off with a fresh mind. I’ve not gone through the way they have acted. I’m going to try and do my part and give my 100 percent from my end. Mouni and Adaa did a fantastic job. It makes you nervous when you are stepping into a show like Naagin but definitely, I am going with a fresh mind. I’m planning to start from the scratch and not really see too much.” \nWhen HT asked about the criticisms that daily soaps garner, Anita said, “I don’t care about the criticism as long as the ratings are coming in. You can’t justify [it to] everybody and please everyone. After 4-5 years [of a running show], you have to do small, illogical things. As long as they work [with the target audience], it’s fine.” \nNaagin 3 has already created a huge hype for all the right reasons. Everyone is eagerly waiting to catch the episodes of it on the small screen. \nFor more scoops and updates, stay tuned to BollywoodLife.  43 pm Topics:",

      "title": "Top Telugu producer's son literally raped me, says Telugu actress",
      "text": "Top Telugu producer's son literally raped me, says Telugu actress Top Telugu producer's son literally raped me, says Telugu actress The incident allegedly took place five years ago, she says. TNN | Apr 11, 2018, 16:12 IST A Telugu actress , whose nude protest sent shockwaves across the country, has now taken her fight against the casting couch menace in Tollywood to the next level. Threatening to expose the big fish of the film industry now, she shared intimate pictures of herself with the son of leading Telugu film producer. “He literally raped me at his studio. He would often tell me that he would introduce me to big directors and producers . As an actor looking for work, I went along with him. One day, he took me inside his studio and raped me,” alleges the actress. The incident allegedly took place five years ago, she says. Earlier, the actress had revealed that an Indian idol singer had propositioned her on numerous occasions and kept asking her to send him her nude pictures. The actress even shared screenshots of her conversation with the singer on WhatsApp, where he’s requesting her to send him pictures. She also took the name of a top director and stated that he too was involved. The nature of the actress’ protest meanwhile, has left the film industry divided, with many claiming that it is not right for her to strip down in protest or claim to ‘expose’ people randomly without taking legal recourse.

      "text": "Irrfan Khan’s Spokesperson Denies Claims Of His Deteriorating Health, Urges Everyone To Refrain From Spreading Rumours On Social Media Irrfan Khan's Spokesperson Issues A Statement Denying Rumours Of The Actor's Deteriorating Health Updated: April 11, 2018 9:03 PM IST Edited by Ishani Bose \nEver since news of Irrfan Khan ‘s illness got out, fans have been concerned just as much as his family and close friends. The actor took to Twitter to first announce that he was suffering from a rare disease, and the moment he did that, rumours of him suffering from Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Grade IV, a deadly brain cancer, started doing the rounds. Later, the actor issued a statement clarifying that he was actually suffering from a disease known as Neuroendocrine tumour. Soon thereafter, he flew out of India for his further treatment. Even after requesting privacy, fans started speculating about his health and the course of his treatment. Right from undergoing surgery to taking Ayurvedic treatment, fans speculated about a number of things. Yet again, reports of Irrfan’s health deteriorating started doing the rounds on the internet last weekend following a tweet by an entertainment journalist. \nWell, now as if to put a stop to all this, Irrfan’s spokesperson has issued a statement denying all the claims. The official statement read, “This latest round of news being spread through social medial in the last few days about Irrfan’s health is absolutely false and there’s no truth to it whatsoever. We as his family and friends again request the members of the media to continue their support and the prayers that have come Irrfan’s way. However it’s not right to spread rumours through medium of social media without fact check or any official validation. In the meanwhile, once again we request everyone to refrain from picking up social media statuses as affirmative developments on someone’s health.” Irrfan Khan Diagnosed With NeuroEndocrine Tumour, Refuses To Take Up Hollywood Projects Read more \nWell, let’s hope that this puts an end to all the speculations surrounding Irrfan Khan’s health. It’s wise and sensitive to let the family deal with the situation peacefully than jumping the gun and spreading rumours about the same. While we wait for an official statement by the family, stay tuned to this space as we keep you updated with all the latest details with regards to his health.

TNN | Apr 11, 2018, 15:27 IST ‘Thala’ Ajith Kumar’s forthcoming film ‘Viswasam’ already has a huge hype on social media. The shooting of the film, which was supposed to roll last month, has been delayed because of the ongoing protest in the industry. On Tuesday, speculations were rife that actor-producer RK Suresh has bagged a role in the much-awaited film. This was after RK Suresh shared a picture with director Siruthai Siva on Twitter. However, RK Suresh has clarified that it was just a casual meeting and that he is not acting in ‘Viswasam’. RK Suresh, who was highly praised for his performance in Bala’s ‘Tharai Thappattai’, is playing the lead role in ‘Billa Pandi’, which is scheduled for a release on May 18, 2018. On the other hand, ‘Viswasam’ is produced by Sathya Jyothi Films and stars Nayanthara as the leading lady. Tipped to be a commercial entertainer, the film also has actors Thambi Ramaiah, Yogi Babu and Robo Shankar on board. D Imaan has been brought in to compose the music. In fact, Imman went on record saying that he has already finished two songs for the project. If things fall into place, ‘Viswasam’ can be expected to release by the end of this year.

      "text": "T+ T- \n\nWith refernce to ‘Unquiet flows the Cauvery’ (April 11), it is unfortunate that an inter-State water dispute that can at best be resolved through peaceful dialogue has been allowed to develop into a raging controversy over linguistic chauvinism and regional identity. While the Centre should be applauded for making efforts to sort out the problem between principal players through the institutional mechanism of the Cauvery River Authority, it cannot escape the accusation of allowing the dispute to go unchecked leading to undesirable and dangerous ramifications. \nThis is particularly true after its failure to avoid face-off between Punjab and Haryana over the construction of Sutlej-Yamuna link canal. It is time the State governments in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu stopped using political pulpits to fan flames of hatred by indulging in parochial opportunism. The Cauvery Tribunal’s 2007 award should be revisited to recalibrate the share of each riparian state based on a rainfall-linked formula. \nShreyans Jain \nNew Delhi \nUnfazed by the vociferous calls of major political parties as well as fringe groups, the fans gathered in large numbers to cheer the Chennai Super Kings, risking their own safety (’Cauvery protesters play spoilsport as city hosts IPL’, April 11). Millions of fans in the State would also have watched the match over television. \nIt brings out the question whether the political parties which called for cancellation of the game are out of sync with realities on the ground. They need to introspect why their sentiments on Cauvery are not shared by a section of non-partisan people from its own State. The fact is that while the people of Tamil Nadu are willing to stand shoulder to shoulder for the cause of Cauvery, at the same time, are not favourably disposed to disruptions to events which provide them entertainment. For them, there is a huge disconnect between cricket as a sport and Cauvery as a political issue. They do not want to mix up the two and have demonstrated that their support cannot be taken for granted by whipping up emotions to score political gains over one against the other on a sensitive issue. \nA word of praise is also due to the Police Deapartment that ensured conduct of the game against all odds. \nV Subramanian \nChennai \nSolar realities \nWith reference to ‘Discom’s rooftop moment’ (April 11). The rapid growth of unconventional energy is borne out by competing low cost in on going solar power agreements. In addition, the intermittent nature of their generation pulls down their offer price as it still has limited customer support. Once the on going research on mass storage fructifies in the near future, demand for solar will go up but so would costs, as the cost of storage could be very high initially. \nThe reliance on conventional energy sources will have to continue for a long time. But they require heavy and time consuming maintenance unlike solar energy. Solar power will provide the vital relief to an overloaded grid and feed in the shortfall during planned maintenance downtime of the majors. \nThis sets up an ideal combination for a healthier and more reliable power grid. . As viable power storage technologies come to occupy prominence,discoms will be needed to cater to an expanding geography. \nR Narayanan \n\nKochhar’s predicament \nWith refernce to ‘Why Chanda Kochhar must resign’ April11), in law a person is innocent till proven guilty, but we tend to judge a person guilty till proved innocent. Chanda Kochhar’s case lie in that territory. But there are a few questions that need answers. Did the ICICI Bank Board give a clean chit to Chanda Kochhar in a hurry? And why did the board seek an independent inquiry into an issue which goes back to 2012? In the larger interests of the staff and investors, Kochhar can take a temporary break and let someone else take over till the issues is sorted out. \nBal Govind",

      "text": "Irrfan Khan's spokesperson… Irrfan Khan’s spokesperson dismisses rumours about his deteriorating health condition – read official statement Contrary to the recent buzz on social media, Irrfan Khan's spokesperson has refuted reports that claim his health is deteriorating By BollywoodLife | Updated: April 11, 2018 8:16 pm comments \nIrrfan Khan ‘s health has been a matter of concern for his fans as much as it is to his family and close friends. When the actor disclosed through the medium of Twitter that he is suffering from a rare disease, rumours started doing the rounds that he was suffering from Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) Grade IV, a deadly brain cancer. However, the actor clarified that it is Neuroendocrine tumour, following which he flew out of the country for the treatment. Despite him requesting privacy, speculations about his health and the course of action continued surfacing. From undergoing surgery to Ayurvedic treatment, several reports were floating around. However, Irrfan’s spokesperson denied all such claims. \nOnce again, internet went abuzz last weekend with reports suggesting that Irrfan’s health is deteriorating following a tweet by an entertainment journalist. In the same context, the actor’s spokesperson has issued a statement dismissing the reports. The official statement reads, “This latest round of news being spread through social medial in the last few days about Irrfan’s health is absolutely false and there’s no truth to it whatsoever. We as his family and friends again request the members of the media to continue their support and the prayers that have come Irrfan’s way. However it’s not right to spread rumours through medium of social media without fact check or any official validation. In the meanwhile, once again we request everyone to refrain from picking up social media statuses as affirmative developments on someone’s health.” ALSO READ: Irrfan Khan is NOT undergoing Ayurvedic treatment for his Neuroendocrine Tumor – read official statement \nThis should put an end to all speculations surrounding Irrfan Khan’s health. While we all wait for an official update on the same, stay tuned to BollywoodLife as we get you all the dope and updates from B-town right here.

However, it seems the filmmaker and actor have let bygones be bygones and a recent picture on their respective Instagram accounts is proof. \nThere are reports that Yami Gautam took the step solely because of her next project Batti Gul Meter Chalu. \n“Yami Gautam was afraid that she might end up losing out on Batti Gul Meter Chalu. The actress visited Divya at her office recently and apologized profusely for the past. Divya graciously hugged Yami and decided to let bygones be bygones,” said a source. \nYami posted a happy selfie with the filmmaker calling her ‘one of the favorite directors’ and even Divya had a sweet response. \nMeanwhile, the actor is prepping up for the character of a lawyer in Batti Gul Meter Chalu. This would be the first time she would share screen space with Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor . The first schedule of the film has wrapped up already but Yami is yet to join the sets. \nDirected by Toilet Ek Prem Katha fame Shree Narayan Singh and bankrolled by Arjun N. Kapoor and Prernaa Arora‘s KriArj Entertainment, the film highlights the problem of high electricity bills despite long hours of power cuts. \nBatti Gul Meter Chalu will be released on August 31, 2018.

      "text": "Government's film body needs to re-invent itself Ajita Shashidhar   20:00 IST \nWill the Information & Broadcasting Ministry's plan to shut down the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) and the Children's Film Society of India (CFSI) and create a large umbrella organization help the cause of the Indian film industry? It does sound like a visionary idea, but the new organization in order to really make an impact on the industry has to be far more involved and proactive. India is the largest film producing country in the world but the Government's support to the industry is miniscule. Yes, NFDC is known to be shelling out over Rs 3,000 crore per year to fund films, but do those films ever see the light of the day? Unlikely. The CFSI also funds children films on a regular basis, but these films rarely get exhibition space. Children films screened in India are largely animated films released by international studios such as Disney. \nIn most evolved markets, especially in countries such as France, Germany and UK, the Government supports the industry in a huge way. \"In France, a considerable percentage of the tax that the Government collects from the film actually goes back to support the industry. They give funds to independent film makers not just to produce their films but also distribute them. They even have caps on how much one can spend on promotions and advertising so that there is fair play. In India we don't have any exhibition space for independent cinema. Multiplexes are not bothered about independent cinema,\" points out independent film-maker, Onir. Why can't the Government film body invest in the growth of the business of films and contribute to the GDP, questions Vikram Malhotra, Founder, Abundantia Entertainment. He says that the Government body should be ideally partnering with the private studios and co-producing films, financing them as well as set up talent infrastructure in addition to just funding independent art films. \"If the investments they are making are channelized properly, the Government could be the largest contributor to the Indian film eco-system. Why can't they partner with say Salman Khan to produce a children's film,\" remarks Malhotra. \nAll that the NFDC actively promotes today is the Film Bazaar which attracts buyers and researchers from across the world to come and buy Indian films. But why can't the Government body distribute and exhibit films too? The Government body also needs to be far more accountable. \"If it's spending Rs 50 crore on a film, it should also have an answer as to how the film is doing in the box office and more importantly, is it being screened in the first place,\" says Malhotra. \nSo, while an umbrella film organization certainly seems to be in the right direction, the body, first and foremost needs to be transparent. It should be a secretariat of motion pictures and promote public-private partnerships. Just funding a few films or at the most getting Indian films to be screened at film festivals abroad isn't enough. The Government-owned film body needs to learn several lessons of public-private partnerships from other markets to really be able to make an impact on the film industry.",

I do it for pure entertainment”, says R Balki — By FPJ Bureau | Apr 11, 2018 07:38 pm FOLLOW US: Social issues may be at the centre of R Balki’s films but the director says his main aim is to always create a story that starts a conversation and is entertaining to the viewers. The director’s latest “Pad Man”, featuring Akshay Kumar, addressed the taboo surrounding menstrual hygiene in India and was based on the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham. Addressing the students of Massachusetts Institute of Technology during their annual India conference, Balki said, “I never do a film for any social purposes. I do it for pure entertainment. My definition of entertainment is what entertains me. When I was doing ‘Cheeni Kum’, a lot of people told me that India is a young country you are doing a movie with a 64-year-old man and a 32-year-old woman. I said no. I am not doing a film with 64-year-old man and 32-year-old man. I am doing a film with Amitabh Bachchhan. They did not get it.” Also Read: I approach Amitabh Bachchan for a film everyday – R Balki Balki said after the movie, he was approached by many elderly people who appreciated its concept. “A lot of people are coming and telling me, I really love your film. It has given me hope in life,” he said. “When you do a concept, which is away from what the people expect entertainment to be, you always ride a different path. But I’ve just done films because I believe in today’s world. The biggest need, the biggest thing to tackle is boredom,” he added. Balki believes in making life interesting and “keep adding some hope, keep wishing life was like this”. “The reason I did ‘Paa’ was. I got a meeting one day and I saw Amitabh Bachchhan for once playing the fool and saying some ridiculous things and Abhishek having a serious look and. it brought all the wisdom. So I said, I want to do a film with these guys where their roles are reversed. I wanted him (Amitabh) to play the son and him (Abhishek) the father,” he said. The director said each of his films were an attempt to “see life in the way people would wish it were”. “I didn’t do this film (Padman) because of a cause, because I wanted to create a conversation. The reason, why I did this film . I agreed with Akshay to do this film, only after I met Murugan,” he said Share this Post:",

      "text": "Tweet \nComedian Kiku Sharda, best known for his role of Palak in Comedy Nights With Kapil , says comedian Kapil Sharma should be given the space to recuperate. \nKapil, who became a household name with show Comedy Nights with Kapil , has been going through a rough patch in his career as well as in his personal life. \nLast year, Kapil (37) had confessed that he was suffering from depression and had undergone treatment for the same. \n\"I have been working with him for years. We have spread a lot of laughter and cheer, so if today he says he is not keeping well, we should give him some space and time. I would request everyone to give him his space, let him relax,\" Kiku told reporters. \nKiku was speaking at Lokmat Maharashtrian of The Year awards last night. Kiku Sharda and Kapil Sharma/Image from Twitter. \nThe comedy star recently made a comeback to small screen with Family Time With Kapil Sharma but the show has not been able to recreate the success of his previous shows and is now reportedly suspended. \n\"I will feel very bad if an artiste like him, who has done such good work, doesn't make a comeback. I really wish him all the best for recovering and he should be back with a bang,\" Kiku said. \nRecently, things took a turn when Kapil filed a police complaint against his former managers Preeti and Neeti Simoes and a journalist, who heads an entertainment website, for defaming him on digital media. \nKapil, in his complaint, accused the journalist of launching \"a malicious propaganda to defame him in digital media\". He said his personal information was leaked to show him in \"negative and poor light\". \nKapil added that the posts published by the website started affecting his mental and emotional health as personal remarks were made about his \"career, relationships, fiance and friendships\" by the journalist. \nWhen asked about how Kapil handled the situation after the journalist posted a telephonic conversation of the comedy star hurling abuses, Kiku said, \"We can discuss about how people behave, may be his way of saying that was not right but he got agitated because of this portal which has written bad things about me too, which I have ignored...The portal isn't responsible but to get angry is justified. But sometimes we can't express the anger or sadness properly.\" \nComedy Nights with Kapil was one of the most popular shows on television but it was discontinued after his fight with co-comedians Sunil Grover, Ali Asgar and others. \nUpdated Date: Apr 11, 2018 19:37 PM",

      "title": "Samir Kochhar on hosting Dhan Dhana Dhan: It’s one of those dysfunctional marriages that become successful",
      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on a paid, ad-free site: Here's what he said in testimony \nGetting together cricket and comedy, Jio launched Dhan Dhana Dhan last week. Apart from comedy stars like Sunil Grover, Shilpa Shinde, Sugandha Mishra, the tri-weekly show will also have popular cricket host Samir Kochhar talking cricket. Having hosted wrap-around shows from the first season, he is a pro at his job and shared that he is thankful to have got the opportunity to get associated with the tournament once again. \nHaving hosted shows during Indian Premier League (IPL) for the last 10 years, he feels it was destiny that got him this show. “With the change in broadcasters, I thought I would be watching the matches at home sitting on my sofa when I got the call to be a part of this show. It all happened suddenly. It’s an interesting move by the makers, where they are getting the two pillars – cricket and comedy together during this season. I am really excited about Dhan Dhana Dhan,” shared the 37-year-old presenter and actor in an exclusive chat with indianexpress.com. \nWhen asked if we will get to see his comic side, Samir quipped, “I really don’t know what they have planned for me. But I will go along and see what’s in store. I think it’s one of those dysfunctional marriages that turn out to be glorious and successful. But I am looking forward to sharing the stage with talented comedy stars like Sunil, Shilpa, Ali Asgar and Sugandha Mishra among more. You will continue to see me talk and discuss cricket with the experts.” \nTalking about the rise of digital space, the Bade Achhe Lagte Hain actor shared, “I think Jio has a fantastic reach and now, the whole world is moving towards the digital space. Even in cricket, you would be surprised that most people watch the match on the go. Very few have the time to luxuriously enjoy it on the big screen. And as for wrap-around shows are concerned, I think it’s a great move. Why shouldn’t we make content that’s unique and has a different flavour. Even when we were doing Extra Innings, the whole idea was to have fun, and now we have only taken the show a step higher.” \nDuring IPL, we all have our favourites but Samir cannot decide on one as he quipped, “I have been too close to the tournament to choose one but I am really happy that the two old teams Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings are back. Also, there’s a lot of excitement this year as all teams have seen a lot of change. So really looking forward to the season.” \nSamir who has been part of The Test Case and Karrle Tu Bhi Mohabbat shared that he will also be seen in Netflix’s Sacred Games. When we mentioned he is becoming the poster boy for web shows, he smiled to say, “I think the world is changing too fast and I need to catch up. But yes, the web world is a great medium and am happy to be associated with it.” \nJio Dhan Dhana Dhan airs every Friday-Sunday on the Jio app at 7:30 pm and on Colors on weekends at 11 pm.

      "text": "नई दिल्ली। केंद्र सरकार ने सरकारी पेट्रोलियम कंपनियों से कहा है कि वे पेट्रोल और डीजल की कीमतों में और इजाफा नहीं करें. ऐसे में अब पेट्रोलियम कंपनियों को अतिरिक्त कीमत का खुद बोझ उठाना पड़ेगा. सूत्रों के अनुसार सरकार के ऑयल मार्केटिंग कंपनियों से कहा है कि वे स्वयं पेट्रोल और डीजल के प्रति लीटर एक रुपये मूल्य का भार उठायें. इस खबर का असर आज पेट्रोलियम कंपनियों के शेयरों में दिखा और उसकी कीमत में जोरदार गिरावट आयी. हिंदुस्तान पेट्रोलियम लिमिटेड के शेयर में आज 7.88 प्रतिशत की गिरावट आयी और यह 28.75 रुपये गिर कर 335.90 पर पहुंच गया. इसी तरह भारत पेट्रोलियम का शेयर लगभग आठ प्रतिशत टूट कर 415 पर पहुंच गया. वहीं, इंडियन ऑयल का शेयर लगभग सात प्रतिशत गिर कर 167 रुपये पर पहुंच गया.\nहाल में क्रूड ऑयल की कीमतों में जोरदार वृद्धि हुई है और यह 3.5 की ऊंचाई पर पहुंच गयी है. भारत अपनी पेट्रालियम जरूरतों के लिए प्रमुख रूप से आयात पर निर्भर है और कुल जरूरत का 50 प्रतिशत हिस्सा बाहर के देशों से मंगाता है.\nहालांकि एचपीसीएल के सीएमडी एचपी सुराना ने एक प्रमुख बिजनेस चैनल से बातचीत में सरकार के ऐसे किसी निर्देश की जानकारी होने से इनकार किया है. उन्होंने कहा है कि क्रूड ऑयल महंगा है इसलिए कीमतें अधिक हैं.\n-एजेंसी\nThe post केंद्र ने सरकारी पेट्रोलियम कंपनियों से कहा, पेट्रोल व डीजल की कीमतों में और इजाफा नहीं appeared first on Legend News: Hindi News, News in Hindi , Hindi News Website,हिन्दी समाचार , Politics News - Bollywood News, Cover Story hindi headlines,entertainment news .",

      "text": "The Indian adaptation of acclaimed Israeli crime-thriller Hostages is in the pipeline, along with 'desi' versions of comedies La Famiglia and Honey Badgers . Cast of the Israeli comedy TV show La Famiglia. Facebook \nAditya Birla Group's Applause Entertainment has taken the rights to three of Armoza Formats' scripted series, according to a company statement to IANS . \n\"We are most excited to be adapting these Armoza shows for India. I have been a big fan of Israeli content as our countries have a close cultural affinity and I believe stories like Hostages, La Famiglia and Honey Badgers are incredibly universal,\" said Sameer Nair, CEO, Applause Entertainment. \n\"Writing, casting and production on all three shows are already underway and filming should commence soon,\" Nair added. \nProduced by Yetzira Ivrit, Hostages is an intense psychological crime-thriller that follows a renowned surgeon about to perform a routine operation on the President. But her family is taken hostage and she is ordered to sabotage the procedure and kill the President. \nLa Famiglia , produced by United Studios of Israel, follows the lives of a suburban family living in the divorce capital of the country. With many reasons to be happy, they have even more reasons to go to therapy — their sex life, his best friend, her complaints and his mother. \n\"Their therapy sessions provide the entertaining basis for the series. Each episode is a new therapy session in which they bring up the most embarrassing, awkward and insane moments that are a part of every family's life. \nHoney Badgers is produced by Naor Zion, and follows the lives of four small-town friends who change their identities to get jobs at one of the world's top financial firms. They will fake it all to appear more sophisticated and achieve their fantasy of opening up their own investment company. \nOn the association, Avi Armoza, CEO of Armoza Formats, said, \"As we continue to expand our scripted and ready-made series catalogues, we are thrilled that Applause Entertainment, a highly acclaimed creative house, has chosen to take three of our top scripted series to be adapted in one of the most important content arenas in the world.\" \nUpdated Date: Apr 11, 2018 18:55 PM tags: #BuzzPatrol #Honey Badgers #hostages #Israel #Israel TV shows #La Famiglia #Now Streaming #NowStreaming also see",

Arjun on Wednesday night took to Twitter, where he shared a link to one of Patralekhaa’s interviews in which she has spoken about her career derailing after a bad decision, crisis of confidence, why it’s hard for outsiders and why she had never asked actor Rajkummar Rao, whom she is dating, for career help. “Hey Patralekhaa, this journey that has been yours can never be taken away from you. You being so honest will inspire many girls to continue to battle it out holding onto their love for acting, just like Rajkummar Rao inspires you and many more out there… I wish you nothing but success,” Arjun wrote.

      "text": "Orkut founder launches Hello, a new social network app in India News IANS   6:55 PM IST \nAs people vouch to delete Facebook in the wake of a massive data breach scandal, Orkut Buyukkokten — a former Google employee who founded the trendsetter social networking website Orkut.com more than a decade ago — on Wednesday launched a new social network “Hello” in India. \nBuilt particularly for the new mobile generation, “Hello” brings people together around their interests to create positive, meaningful, authentic connections and sustained social engagement, the company said in a statement. \n“We designed ‘Hello’ to help you make connections in the real world. It’s a social network built on loves not likes, and I’m delighted to say ‘Hello’ to India once again,” said Buyukkokten, now the CEO of San Francisco-based Hello Network Inc. \nThe app, currently available in Brazil with nearly one million downloads, was in the beta test mode in India for the past several months. \nTest users spent over 320 minutes each month on the app, thus, reflecting the popularity of sport, entertainment, devotion and technology in India. \n“Today’s online networks force people to treat each other totally differently from how they would behave face-to-face. Technology should help us become more understanding, more optimistic, kinder and better people,” the Orkut founder added. \nThe app is available on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. \nOrkut was owned and operated by Google and was named after its creator, Orkut Buyukkokten. \nGoogle shut down Orkut on September 30, 2014.

      "text": "Music composer Mithoon: Creating music for Prabhudheva’s Mercury was a challenge \nDirector Prabhudheva says it is a myth that only those who play challenging roles are appreciated by the audience. The key is to entertain the viewers and win their hearts, he says. “If you are playing a hero you have to connect with the audience. It is not that only if you do challenging roles then people will like you. You don’t have to be a NASA scientist to show your acting (skills),” Prabhudheva told PTI. \n“Not all those who play tough roles are given the best actor awards, those who manage to entertain the audience also get recognition.” After the success of his Tamil film Devi, Prabhudheva says he was given similar offers but he prefers directing over acting. “I like both (acting and directing) as today there are a lot of exciting opportunities for me as an actor. But I love directing more than acting,” he says. \nPrabhudheva says whether he is working as an actor or as a director, he tries to give his hundred percent to his craft. “Once you become popular, it doesn’t mean you let go of things. Rather you have to work harder and make sure that you maintain the name that you have made for yourself in the industry. I am in that position that I can do things I like and want to experiment. Today I am an improved actor,” he says. \nOther than films, Prabhudheva says, he knows nothing. “In the initial days, I wanted to make a name for myself here. Then I went after money and did some films. Today, I do films for passion,” he says. He is looking forward to the release of Mercury, a silent thriller in which he plays an antagonist. \n“This film looks tough but I never felt it was tough as the director was very good. If I would have made this film, I would not have been able to finish it. I would not have been able to do justice,” he says. “The genre is new, I wonder how you can make a film without dialogues. When you see the film, you will never feel it is a silent film.” \nBeing a director himself, Prabhudheva says he never interferes with the direction process of another person. “…When I act, I just act, I hear the story and listen to the instructions of the director. At times, I show another take, if the directors like it, they retain it, even if they don’t, I am ok,” he says. \nThe film is set to release this Friday For all the latest Entertainment News , download Indian Express App More Related News",

      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on a paid, ad-free site: Here's what he said in testimony \nThe new cast of Student of the Year 2 was announced earlier today. The film witnesses the debut of Ananya Panday and Tara Sutaria. Many might have heard the name Ananya Panday as the girl has been quite a favourite of paparazzi but Tara’s name piqued interest. After all, everyone wants to know who is this girl making her debut with Dharma Productions. \nTara Sutaria was meant to be in the movies one day as the girl has been showcasing her talent since she was a child. \nTara has been a professional singer from the age of seven and has performed in many operas and competitions. When Tara was only 13, she participated in Sony ’s Entertainment Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega which was judged by Farah Khan and Anu Malik. At the competition, she performed an opera and received a standing ovation from the audience. Not just singing, Tara is also a skilled sketch artist as she presented Anu and Farah with portraits that she made. \nIn another round of the same show, Tara sang as well as performed ballet dancing. Her performance stunned the judges and they showered her with all the praise. Looking back, it looks like Farah and Anu can spot talent in a moment. \nShe is an accomplished singer who has performed concerts in London, Tokyo, Lavasa and Mumbai. \nTara’s big break in TV was as the host of Disney channel show Big Bada Boom. \nTara has also displayed her acting talent in various shows. She has acted in Disney show The Suite Life of Karan & Kabir which was the Indian adaptation of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. Tara’s character was the one that was played by Ashley Tisdale in the US version. \nFollowing this, Tara was cast in another Disney show Oye Jassie. The show was adapted from Jessie and here Tara played the lead role. \nTara has also played the lead role in Raell Padamsee’s production of the musical Grease. \nTara Sutaria’s big break in TV was as the host of Disney channel show Big Bada Boom. Tara Sutaria is an accomplished singer who has performed concerts in London, Tokyo, Lavasa and Mumbai Tara Sutaria is also a trained dancer. \nIn 2015, Tara Sutaria was invited at TedX in Mumbai where she performed Phantom of the Opera’s “Think of Me” and Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You”. \nWith so much talent, Bollywood was the obvious next step for Tara and making her debut in Student of the Year 2 is just the first of many big achievements for the young star. \nStudent of the Year 2 releases November 23, 2018 For all the latest Entertainment News , download Indian Express App © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd More Top News",
