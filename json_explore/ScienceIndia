The intention is to keep them suitable for public display at a funeral, for religious reasons, or for medical and scientific purposes such as their use as anatomical specimens. [1] The three goals of embalming are sanitization, presentation and preservation (or restoration). Embalming has a very long and cross-cultural history, with many cultures giving the embalming processes a greater religious meaning.

      "text": "Home : Four civilians, soldier die in Kashmir, militants escape Four civilians, soldier die in Kashmir, militants escape in Encounter between terrorists, security forces underway in Kulgam Four civilians and a soldier were killed on Wednesday as a fierce gunfight between militants and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam district sparked off violent street protests and a call for a two-day shutdown in the Valley. Sepoy S. Gunakar Roy was killed when militants hiding in a house in Wani Mohalla in Khudwani area fired at security personnel closing in on them. Two other security personnel were wounded in the fighting. The security forces fired back in a bid to capture the militants, said to be linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). As the fighting raged, hundreds of people poured out of their homes and attacked the security forces with stones. The security personnel opened fire. Doctors named the civilians who died as Aijaz Ahmad Palla, 30, who had a gunshot injury, Faisal Elahi, 15, Bilal Ahmad Dar, 17, and Sharjeel Sheikh 28. Police issued a statement saying the civilian deaths took place as a result of crossfire between the militants and security forces. This was strongly contested by locals who assert that the civilians were shot dead by the security forces determined to break up the street protests. In the end, the troops fired explosives to destroy the house where the militants had hidden. Two other houses in the vicinity caught fire. But there was no trace of the militants, who appeared to have escaped in the clashes between civilians and security forces. Police officials stated this after clearing the debris of the house. Four injured civilians have been referred to Srinagar for specialized treatment. Informed sources said over 40 civilians were injured in street clashes. The condition of two of them was said to be critical.   Authorities ordered the closure of all schools and colleges in Kulgam and Internet services were suspended in south Kashmir areas. A Station House Officer (SHO) sustained a head injury during clashes between the civilian protesters and the security forces in north Kashmir's Baramulla town. Similar clashes also erupted in north Kashmir's Sopore town as news about the deaths of civilians in Kulgam spread. Unrest also gripped Anantnag, Pulwama and Shopian towns. Student protests rocked Kashmir University in Srinagar, the Islamic University of Science and Technology in Awantipora in south Kashmir and Degree College in Bandipora in north Kashmir. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Chairman Yasin Malik was detained soon after he and separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called for a two-day shutdown in the Kashmir Valley on Thursday and Friday to denounce the Kulgam killings. While Malik addressed the media in person, Geelani and the Mirwaiz spoke to the journalists over telephone. After the press conference, Malik set out on a protest march but was detained, triggering more clashes between JKLF supporters and security forces in Srinagar.",

      "text": "NASA to study tiny sea creatures to understand Earth's climate Wednesday, 11 April 2018 | http://www.nerve.in/news:2535004176300 | channel: Americas \" --IANS\" Washington, April 11 - In a first, a team of scientists from NASA are on a research mission to study phytoplankton -- the tiny sea creatures -- and their impact on the atmosphere and climate on Earth. The North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES), which is in its fourth and final deployment stage, is set to study to four distinct phases of the world's largest phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic. Previous three deployments have confirmed a distinct shift in the annual cycle of the phytoplankton bloom as well as a lack of larger-sized plankton during the peak of the bloom. Most scientists studying the bloom head to sea during its climax in late spring and early summer. We did that, but we also went out during the other seasons to fully capture the minimum and transitions of the bloom, Rich Moore, Deputy Project Scientist at NAAMES, said in a statement. This thoroughness pays off as our ship-based scientists use these data to fully describe the entirety of the plankton bust/boom cycle. No one has done this before, and we're excited about the science findings that are beginning to trickle out now, Moore said The study is set to research the ascending transition of the bloom, which occurs after the phytoplankton minimum in February. In the March-April phase, the plankton are growing steadily, with their abundance in the water continuing to increase or accumulate toward the maximum of the bloom between May and July. The NAAMES campaign also provides a unique opportunity for researchers aboard Atlantis to do experiments that study growth and decay of the phytoplankton population. For scientists watching the rates of growth, this is the exciting time, because the accumulation rate is expected to be going through the roof and stay high for the next few months, Moore said. Rates of phytoplankton accumulation are critical for understanding the ocean conditions that lead to phytoplankton growth and its timing, a key to unlocking the environmental drivers and controls of biological dynamics, the report said. For the study, the team is combining global data from NASA satellites with the ship, aircraft, and autonomous assets such as floats, along with laboratory research and balloon data. Scientists are also conducting meteorological balloon launches from the ship to understand the link between the ocean, atmospheric particles and clouds. --IANS",

      "text": "April 11, 2018 22:20   22:30 IST more-in ‘Now we are emphasising on a few, but bigger grants to achieve the target’ \nThe Defence Research and Development Organisation is celebrating its diamond jubilee celebrations. DRDO chairman S. Christopher who was at the DefExpo near Chennai on Wednesday, explains the organisation’s plan to meet the challenges and requirements of the developing field. Excerpts: The Defence Ministry’s ‘Make in India’ campaign focuses a lot on indigenisation of the assets and as a State-owned organisation, do you have specific plans to consolidate your efforts towards intended results? \nWe have been involved in research in three ways. Doing research on our own, aiding research and joint research. Academic institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology are experts in theory and we know how technology reflects on the ground. To meet targeted oriented research, we have revised our way of supporting these academic institutions. Earlier, we gave small grants to many institutions and now we are focusing on a few, but bigger grants so that the target can be achieved for the complete product. Could you elaborate on recent collaborations with academic institutions... \nThe recent ones have been setting up the Centre of Propulsion Technology (CoPT) in IIT Bombay and IIT Madras. We have also joined hands with IIT Delhi and Jadavpur University. We are planning to collaborate with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru. The DRDO had set up labs across the country to look for solutions for specific requirements for the sector. But, over the years, has DRDO felt any need for more labs to cater to research in any developing field. \nThe P. Rama Rao Committee has recommended against the DRDO setting up more labs. But, without setting up more labs, we are expanding our horizons as and when we feel a specific field needed more focus. The attrition rate and the missing of deadlines by the DRDO are two major issues often cited while reviewing the performance of the organisation. Your views: \nThe attrition rate has often been cited but that is not true. The attrition rate is only .5% and there are normal retirements. As for the performance, DRDO functions are on a par with the functions of the other research organisations in other parts of the world. Our aim and determination have always been to meet the deadlines and we have been taking every possible effort to deliver on time.",

      "text": "Facebook \nDark matter is said to be a mystery to scientists around the globe. The limited understanding of the dark matter and energy lead us to blind signals from intelligent alien life. This matter is present in the dimensions which humans cannot perceive. \nWhen a human thinks about other intelligent beings, then they tend to see from their perceptive and conscience. According to the Gabriel de la Torre who is from the University of Cadiz in Spain said that we have limited our vision in the world and it is hard for us all to admit the same. We try to differentiate with other possibilities. The intelligence which is based on dark matter or energy forms makes almost 95 percent of the universe and we are only able to glimpse the same. \nThe researchers had conducted an experiment by taking 137 people with them. The experiment is based to distinguish the aerial photographs with artificial structures which include buildings and roads from others with natural elements like a river, mountains. For example, in one of the images, a tiny character disguised as a gorilla in order to see if the participants had seen the insertion of the same or not. De la Torre said that it is very significant and representative move which shows how our brain works at the same Same time. \nThe researchers before performing the experiment, they assessed the participants with a series of questions in order to determine if they are intuitive or rational and at the last, it shows that intuitive individuals can identify the gorilla photo more times than the rational individuals. He added that “ If we transfer this to the problem of searching for other non-terrestrial intelligence, the question arises about whether our current strategy may result in us not perceiving the gorilla.” \nIn the observable universe, there are more than 200 billion galaxies as per a rough estimate. Dark matter is a non-luminous form of matter which doesn’t emit light or energy which makes it pretty difficult to detect. Also, the dark matter is categorized into two types of matter. The cold dark matter is the particle which is slow and weakly interactive while the hot dark matter is high-speed and highly energized randomly moving particles that were created after the Big Bang similar to how matter and antimatter are known to have originated. \nScientists estimate that of the total matter available in the universe, only 15% makes up as visible ordinary matter while more than 80% is made up of dark matter. It is tough to detect since it doesn’t emit light or energy, however, it has gravitational effects which can help detect and study it further supporting which, countless researchers across the globe are studying it. A recently published paper by Indian scientists in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics disclosed details on dark matter’s effects on gravity. \nBack in the 1930s, the first partial evidence supporting the existence of dark matter came to light. By 1970s, scientists came onto the conclusion that since galaxies rotate at a fast speed, the gravity exerted by its own matter might not be sufficient to keep it from bursting and therefore, dark matter theories were brought to life by late 1980s. A number of observations made by scientists with respect to cosmic microwave background (CMB), Gravitational lensing, Redshift-space distortions, Lyman-alpha forest, and other experiments were conducted. \nAs said, scientists know very little about the dark matter. There are several models as aforementioned that were considered for studying the dark matter and dark energy of which, one was Cosmic microwave background (CMB) which is the remnant radiation released and left over after the Big Bang along with other forms of matter such as matter, antimatter, etc. \nResearchers believe that cold dark matter puts a slower velocity in its matter and thus, it is linked to the early universe that facilitated density differences between the early universe and what it is today. When compared to high-energy hot dark matter which isn’t capable of maintaining the pace and density differences required, the latter has been ruled out. \nAccording to a study which was   Acta Astronautica, it said that the researchers also pose how different classes of intelligent civilizations can do it and they are based on five factors which are biology, longevity, psychosocial aspects, technological progress and distribution in space.

And are you flying out of LAX that Sunday? If so, definitely remain in Santa Monica, the temps will be much more pleasant than in Hollywood, you'll be closer to the airport on departure day, and you can spend Saturday touring about if you wish. Take the expo rail from Santa Monica to the California Science Center , have lunch downtown, then subway to Hollywood for the afternoon. Or was the plan to do Universal? You could even rent a car in Santa Monica and tour around all Saturday if you wished. You'll be up early on east-coast jet lag and can see and do a lot on Saturday morning. And if it's really hot, you can head back to SM in the late afternoon when you're miserable in Hollywood.\nMentioned in this post &#xe041 &#xe01a Santa Monica California &#xe002 Hollywood 1,346 Reviews Los Angeles, CA &#xe002 California Science Center 3,392 Reviews Los Angeles, CA &#xe03b",

Mr. Narendra Modi has been named as the No. 1 fitness influencer in India followed by Baba Ramdev and actor Akshay Kumar. GOQii had earlier released the GOQii India fit report that found in an unaided survey that 75% respondents named Baba Ramdev and Akshay Kumar as someone they would trust for health advice. The team undertook further surveys and research, to reveal other influencers whom people look up to when it comes about health and fitness. Narendra Modi, PM of India: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is one of the most admired personalities globally. While he has been mocked time and again for having been a tea seller, he has also been praised for his economic politics and the various political decisions. He is definitely one of the most energetic and fit prime ministers that India has seen. His secret to health and fitness is nothing but just being disciplined and waking up early in the morning and practicing Yoga. He practices yoga daily for an hour every morning irrespective where he is. This improves both his physical and mental well-being. He is the brains behind proposing an International Yoga day. His fitness mantra can surely be a lesson to many. Baba Ramdev: Yoga Guru Born as Ramdev to parents who were farmers in a small village in Haryana. He became popular and a populist hero by advocating Yoga. According to him health is a way of life.

      "text": "11.04.2018 Gas rates \nThe gunshots began before long afterwards midnight on 17 The middle of summer, 1918. Chaotically, the attack band executed Tzar Bishop II, his 13-yr-aged boy Alexei, daughters Region, Anastasia, Olga and Tatiana, helpmeet Alexandra and their attendants in the excavation of a seller box in Yekaterinburg, occidental Siberia. \nThe cadaver were distant вЂ“В first near motor lorry, then beside knight and handcart, to a fathomless area titled Ganina Yama 25km forth. Thither, the Bolsheviks leaning the cadaver in, and began to decompose the corpse in battery-acid. \nThe Ganina Yama cavity has tod been reborn into a cloister knotty inert gas definition chemistry . It is a churchgoing Funfair, with shrines, department store and cafes, and a people of icons in fame of the tzar. Core, animated show chatter of the tsarвЂ™s вЂњultimate, redemptory sacrificeвЂќ, and objective to the at once consecrated area, where, old, indisposed-search women are murmur supplication. \nThe haji are positive they birth arrived at the last resting blemish of their exemplar. Apart from they havenвЂ™t. It roll outside, the Bolsheviks hadnвЂ™t brought sufficiency dot to shatter the carcass fully. So when anesthetic villagers began to canvass left-handed query, the recruit retrieved the stiff and urgently looked championing added apartment to immerse their misdeed. \nWith the Communistic Collection unkeen to publicise the description of the familyвЂ™s casualty, the carcass would stay at Porosenkov Exponent, full championing the beside threescore caducity. In 1978, an Home Sacred calling producer titled Geli Ryabov began a original comb through. No individual be familiar with reason he started; possibly heвЂ™d been leaning elsewhere astir the infield-studded stays the Tzarina had been fatiguing gas utility. Or reason, when a gathering next he wanted an imperative interview with Leonid Statesman in Moscow to manifest the clappers and fastball ridden-skulls, he was inverted fine-tune. \nNotwithstanding, the cadaver were reburied in Yekaterinburg, and it would but be when the Council Unity flatten that the plentiful anecdote was trumped-up common. Still so, the be left of exclusive niner cadaver were cured. The additional cardinal corpse, children Region and Alexei, were endow xvi senescence following, in 2007, in a branch sepulchre around 20 metres out. Now, lucid crosses site the concealment plat in Porosenkov Exponent, in wholly distinguish to the tawdriness at Ganina Yama. When The Free visited the commemoration, the particular mortal in flock was a person close his canine. \nYearly, on the day of the execution, a nighttime journey from Yekaterinburg moves past 50 around metres gone the commemoration. This gathering, as with every old yr, hour of the haji off in, and alternatively carried onward, in relation to Ganina Yama. \nNikolai Neuimin was thing of the 2007 check association that place the examination morsel of the inhumation enigma stable. The grand, bewhiskered pedantic tod cranium the Romanoff anecdote division in the resident Sverdlovsk Limited Version Museum. \nHis pocket-sized display expose the living artefacts: the virgin verification, the rod, and the fe stick of the excavation pane, cured from the nowadays-ruined seller co-op electricity in costa rica . Ace of the offer is the rattling low story into the butchery, the 1919 authorization next to the royalist scientist Nikolai Sokolov. Mr SokolovвЂ™s assertion to possess cured the linger in Ganina Yama compass because been contradicted beside quatern fork genetical to pieces. \nMr Neuimin yell the Sokolov theme вЂњthe scribble of a madmanвЂќ. The exclusive absolute tell the scientist offered, he states, were castanets, and these were consequent proved not to be of anthropoid source. \nImplausibly, the story tarry the base championing the certified pose of the Received Religion, which repudiate to construe the corpse are anyplace however Ganina Yama. \nIn 1998, the stays behind of the offset nine-spot stiff were reburied in a k ritual in St Campaign. The Authoritative management stayed gone from the obsequies, nevertheless cardinal senility following, the religion glorified Bishop II and his kith and kin. \nWhen the tarry of the examination cardinal carcass were endow in 2007, Accepted regime refused to avow them: they were saints, finally. In the jumble, the Slavic Sovereign state Depository stepped head, and, next to eccentricity of nemesis, the stiff of Alexei and Region, the TsarвЂ™s at once holy children, terminated up in the identical artist as the cranium and golden-cogged schmoose of Adolf Dictator. \nThe ChurchвЂ™s rigid stance has inclined arise to a refinement of unfamiliarity and fury some the Romanovs, hold the historiographer. And at its extremes is a motion that has concern be recognized as tsarebozhniki or RussiaвЂ™s вЂњtsar worshippersвЂќ, who snap only manner also to glorify the whole the tzar did. \nThe tzar-admirer orientation is mild as it is pretty: the theoretically peaceable Bishop II sacrificed himself and his kinsfolk to expiate championing the impiety of the unabridged Slavic country. On the other hand it is the вЂњWahhabism of the Conformist faithвЂќ,В says Mr NeuiminВ вЂ“В a fancy that has accustomed parturition to whatever turn of over-the-counter reliable untruths. \nAttendance carry on of the 1990s, RussiaвЂ™s tzar worshippers were initially a strange bundle that sporadic cashed interest to. However early this yr, the rebellious bound of the migration showed its set la gasolina lyrics translation . The spark was a modern pic, portraying вЂ“В at present, erotically вЂ“В the correctly comedy of a romance ‘tween Bishop and a adolescent danseuse, Matilda Kshesinskaya. The administrator of the вЂњblasphemousвЂќ pic, Alexei Uchitel, was targeted in cardinal branch fire-raising set. \nYekaterinburg adage its detached handwriting of Matilda grievance, and single mainly wild revolve. In ahead of time Sept, a 39-gathering-absinthe rammed a handcart pie-eyed with fuel canisters into the cityвЂ™s World celluloid, which had been regular to cover the movie. The blitz didnвЂ™t positively exercise as plotted, but, and the guess was artificial to begun himself at infirmary with grim smoulder. \nHither, he admitted to investigators that he had tired the old period receiving cleric brief in the Holy place on the Origin, the religion dominating the film. \nThe Tabernacle on the Lineage in Yekaterinburg.

A no problem crossbreed mark the thorough fix of the trader household is, not unexpectedly, unheeded alongside parishioners. \nThe place has served as a typical backcloth representing opposition facing the celluloid.

      "text": "Facebook \nStargazers, space observers and enthusiasts, and whomsoever get fascinated by mesmerizing celestial events are always on the lookout for light shows, sightings, star gazing and more. If you are one of ‘em, you must be familiar with the Aurora Borealis which is a marvelous light show displayed in the northern regions that produces beautiful color patterns when electrons discharge and fall back into the Earth’s atmosphere which is a complex procedure, Until now, you must have heard about Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights and Aurora Australis or Southern Lights but observers and amateur scientists have recently captured a new kind of this phenomenon event in the Northern region. It is touted as “Steve” as it is a newly discovered kind of aurora borealis which is totally breathtaking. \nPer the reports, auroras are a combination of magnetic fields, solar winds, and electrical currents, auroras in both the poles have been studied extensively in the past few years. However, this newly discovered northern light “Steve” is bit different when compared to Aurora Borealis. Steve displays narrow ribbons of vivid colors consisting of green and purple hue which can be seen as far as east-west at latitudes closer to the equator of the Earth. The phenomena are sought to happen at twice the altitude in the sky where regular auroras happen. \nThe world of science, physics, astronomy which is the first pace with new discoveries happening every fortnight, nothing much has been discovered about the auroras for the past 20 years or so. This time, a group of Aurora watchers gathers in a specific place in Canada and the credit for photographing the newly discovered aurora “Steve” goes to this team. The discovery attracted a lot of acclaim including recognition by scientists at a symposium in 2016. The research paper was drafted under the title “Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement” which got   Science Advances. \nWhen the group of aurora watchers came across “Steve”, they misunderstood it as a Proton arc which is caused due to protons and not electrons as it auroras. This led to a collaboration between professional scientists and group of aurora chasers based in Canada from where Steve was identified as a newly discovered kind of Aurora. According to Eric Donovan, an aurora researcher at the University of Calgary, Steve is caused at an altitude of 450 km when a ribbon of hot gases 25 km wide gets warm at a temperature of 3000° Celsius with wind speed at 6 km/s which creates this celestial phenomenon which although isn’t rare but it is one of the subjects that wasn’t studied in detail previously. \nThe reason why it formed is suggested as rivers of electrically charged particles flowing in the upper atmosphere called as subauroral ion drifts. This creates a ribbon which is visible to naked eyes. However, the subject is in a debate where some scientists believe that it can be a form of airglow where the upper atmosphere releases a tiny amount of light after being warmed by the Earth’s surface and the Sun. The discovery was made by a group without any science background and then, it was analyzed by researchers in detail.

As Monkeytown Records' artists Gajek, Modeselektor, Moderat and Anstam delivered most of the music, we are happy to release their contribution to the film music as a digital soundtrack album, featuring outtakes of Moderat, a newly produced track by Modeselektor as well as Gajek's edits of Gustav Mahler's 'Symphony No. 1' as the musical leitmotiv of the film. 'When it comes to bringing electronic music to life and creating a unique experience for people, Monkeytown Records surely is one of the most influential record labels worldwide. Working with Gajek and Szary has been one of my most exciting experiences compiling a soundtrack and the way we have been collaborating is fairly extraordinary in the movie business. My images of the Californian desert perfectly unit with the chosen tracks. Berlin meets America – in it's best and most exciting way!' (RP Kahl,director of A THOUGHT OF ECSTASY)Tracklist:",

      "text": "Posted on April 11, 2018 by admin \nBEST WAY TO START MY BIRTHDAY WEEKEND!!! •I have been working on this particular program for about 6 months, i guess you can consider it a “pilot program.” The program ranges from learning basic science to human anatomy to exploring their physical, mental, and emotional capacity for kids up to 15yo. Of course, for the sake of the workshop, they did a little bit of everything, just to get a feel for it. •im so proud of EACH and EVERYONE of these kids. Big shout out to those who faced their fears of being in front of people. (I hate it too, don’t worry 😉) •I’m so thankful for @thebeprojectpresents for giving me the opportunity. Now i know what i need to work on. #wellnessandfitness #strengthtraining #exerciseforkids #sofree #letthembekids #healthyfun ・・・ Here’s a recap of our “BE” So Free workshop with Ms. Ty @sofreediary from April 7, 2018. Our youth had a ball. We worked on balance, stretching, speed, coordination, reaction time, strength training, and teambuilding. We did this all the kid friendly fun way, with @sofreediary as the fitness professional. Our youth worked together like never before, encouraging each other to finish what they started and challenging each other to do better. They cheered from the sidelines and called each other out for some healthy competition. I love them all and I’m so appreciative of all the support and love I get in return. Thanks you to my fitness partner @sofreediary, the supporting families and of course our WONDERFUL youth. 👑– CEO Brittney Watson 👑👸🏾🏃🏾‍♂️🏃🏾‍♀️🤸🏾‍♂️🤸🏾‍♀️🧘🏾‍♀️🧘🏾‍♂️🏆🏅🤴🏾👑 #BE #letusBE #BEyou #BEwhoyouare #BElieve #BEmore #Baltimore #BaltimoreYouth #youthenrichment #youthworkshops #theBEprojectpresents #BESoFree #BESoFreeFit #kidfitness #kidworkouts #fitnessforkids #kidshealth",

      "text": "Mumbai, Apr 11 (PTI) The suicide note purportedly written by a debt-ridden farmer, who allegedly ended his life in Maharashtras Vidarbha region yesterday, has been sent to handwriting experts to verify its authenticity, a senior police official said today.\nThe farmer, Shankar Chayare (50), who hailed from Yavatmal district in Vidarbha killed himself by consuming a poisonous chemical, apparently due to crop-loss, the official said.\nAccording to the police, the note mentions the name of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and holds him responsible for the suicide.\nThe official said the police did not recover the note from the spot, but his daughter submitted it to them last night.\n\"The purported suicide note was submitted by Chayares daughter Jayashree to Ghatanji police last night after it was circulated on social media,\" Ganesh Bhavsar, in-charge of the Ghatanji police station, told PTI.\n\"In the two-page note, PM Modis name was written on the second page. Some sentences in the note have been struck out and some letters in the note are not written in a uniform style. Therefore, we have sent this note to the forensic sciences department to the handwriting experts,\" Bhavsar said.\n\"We have collected various documents from the deceased farmers residence, in which his handwriting is available. That handwriting will be matched with the one in the suicide note,\" he added.\nTalking to PTI, Yavatmal Superintendent of Police M Rajkumar said, \"The police have sent the purported suicide note to handwriting experts to verify its authenticity.\"\nOnce the hand writing experts file their report, further course of action will be decided, he said adding that investigation in the case is on.\nThe police had yesterday said the loss of cotton crop due to a pest attack is suspected to be the prime reason behind Chayare taking the extreme step.

One of the rapists was called from Meerut to “satisfy his lust”. The girl was confined using sedatives, then strangled and hit on the head twice with a stone — “in order to make sure” she was dead. But not before another accused, a police personnel, asked the others to “wait because he wanted to rape” her one last time.And all this, to “dislodge” a group of Bakherwal Muslim nomads from Rasana village in Kathua near Jammu.These are just some of the chilling details in 18-page chargesheet filed Monday by J&K Police’s Crime Branch against the 8 accused in the rape and murder of the girl who went missing from near her house in Rasana on Jan.10 — her body was found 7 days later in the forests nearby.In the days that followed, the chargesheet states, the accused paid Rs 1.5 lakh as a bribe to local policemen who knew where the girl was kept and helped cover up the crime initially.The killing had sparked outrage across J&K with Govt   handing over the case to the Crime Branch following protests from the Bakherwal community. The case took a communal turn in Kathua, where an outfit called Hindu Ekta Manch was set up by politicians in support of the accused. Among those who backed the Manch were Lal Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga, 2 BJP ministers in CM Mehbooba Mufti’s Cabinet.According to chargesheet, the mastermind behind the rape and murder is retired revenue official Sanji Ram who is among the eight arrested, along with his son Vishal Jangotra and nephew, believed to be a juvenile. Crime Branch had also arrested SPOs Deepak Khajuria and Surinder Kumar, a Rasana resident Parvesh Kumar, Assistant Sub Inspector Anand Dutta and Head Constable Tilak Raj in the case. Dutta and Raj were arrested on charges of attempting to destroy evidence.According to the chargesheet, the girl’s father Mohd Yousuf lodged a complaint on Jan12 at Hiranagar station that his daughter who “had gone for grazing horses in the nearby forest at about 1230 hrs on Jan.10” had not returned. A FIR was lodged and police arrested Ram’s nephew, leading to allegations of a cover-up by Bakherwal community. On Jan.22, the case was transferred to Crime Branch.The chargesheet states that Ram masterminded the conspiracy to kidnap and, later rape and kill the girl. It states that he made SPO Khajuria and the juvenile a “part of the conspiracy and assigned them tasks separately and individually”.indianexpress Kathua chargesheet reveals gory details of how 8-year-old was raped, bludgeoned https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kathua-chargesheet-reveals-gory-details-of-how-8-yr-old-was-raped-bludgeoned/story-UNKVij0yKD6FGWbGSdgu9O.html Kathua rape, murder case was a plot to dislodge Muslim Bakarwal community: J&K Police chargesheet https://scroll.in/article/875143/kathua-rape-murder-case-was-a-plot-to-dislodge-muslim-bakarwal-community-j-k-police-chargesheet Raped, sedated, raped 'one last time': Chilling details from Kathua chargesheet https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/raped-sedated-raped-one-last-time-chilling-details-from-kathua-chargesheet-1209875-2018-04-11 Omar on Kathua rape-murder: ‘Act against on BJP ministers who emboldened lawyers’ http://indianexpress.com/article/india/omar-on-kathua-rape-murder-act-against-on-bjp-ministers-who-emboldened-lawyers-5132358/ Srinagar: Hours after J&K Police registered a case against lawyers who tried to prevent Crime Branch officials from filing a chargesheet in the Kathua rape and murder case, National Conference working president Omar Abdullah said that lawyers got emboldened by actions of two ministers in PDP-BJP coalition Govt   in the state and asked the Govt   whether action will be taken against them.NC also demanded transfer of the case from Kathua to any other court for a free and fair trial in the backdrop of lawyers’ protests.indianexpress Unnao alleged rape: BJP MLA holds grip on village, so girl who alleged rape has to hide http://indianexpress.com/article/india/uttar-pradesh-bjp-mla-kuldeep-singh-sengar-holds-grip-on-village-so-girl-who-alleged-rape-has-to-hide-5132286/ Unnao:The uproar over the death in custody of the father of a 17-year-old girl who alleged she had been raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar saw UP police arrest Atul Singh, the MLA’s brother.

Police also promised to question MLA as part of their probe.But such is the clout of Sengar and his family, so complete their grip on the village of Makhi, barely 15 km from Unnao, that the girl and her family have refused to return home, saying they fear for their lives.“Following a request made by the victim’s family, I have arranged accommodation for them in Unnao,”DM said.Girl’s mother, who was waiting at the residence of DM, said: “We will not return to the village until the situation is normal. MLA and his associates must be planning something. No one in the village will dare support us. No one will raise his voice against MLA and his family.

The board has a week to produce the signatures of the emperor who died in 1666, almost 18 years after the monument he built in the memory of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, was completed.Hearing a 2010 appeal filed by the ASI, the court directed the board to produce documents in support of its claim that none other than Shah Jahan declared the Taj a wakf property.“Who in India will believe it belongs to the wakf board? These kind of issues must not waste the time of the Supreme Court,” a bench led by CJI Dipak Misra told the board.Wakf is an endowment of land or property by a Muslim for a religious, educational or charitable purpose.In 2010, ASI had petitioned the court against the wakf board’s July 2005 decision ordering that the Taj be registered as the latter’s property. There is a stay on the order.Appearing for the board, senior advocate VV Giri said Shah Jahan executed a wakfnama in favour of the board, a submission challenged by ASI. “Then you show us the original deed executed by Shah Jahan. Show us the signature,” the bench shot back, granting a week’s time on Giri’s request.CJI Misra, however, had a few questions for the board.“How did he (Shah Jahan) sign the wakfnama? He was in jail and used to view the monument while in custody,” the country’s top judge said.The bench also reminded the board that 17th century monument and other heritage structures built by the Mughals passed on to the British after the end of the Mughal rule. After Independence, the monuments vested with Govt   and were being managed by ASI. ASI advocate ADN Rao said there was no wakfnama.

CBI has claimed that Prajapati was abducted along with Sohrabuddin and his wife Kausarbi from a luxury bus on Nov.23, 2005 by policemen from Gujarat while they were on way to Sangli from Hyderabad. Sohrabuddin was killed in a staged encounter on Nov.26, 2005 in Gujarat, subsequent to which, Kausarbi was also killed. Prajapati, a witness to the abduction, was killed on Dec.26, 2006, also in a staged encounter, the agency had alleged.The witnesses on Tuesday contradicted CBI’s case that the three were abducted at the same time from the bus by alleging that Prajapati was then at their home. CBI had maintained that Prajapati was present in the bus on Nov.23 before his arrest 6 days later.Special Public Prosecutor BP Raju, however, did not declare the two witnesses hostile.On Tuesday, a father-son duo from Rajasthan, deposed as prosecution witnesses 68 and 69. The father told the court that he had built a house in Bhilwara in Rajasthan in 2004, where he lived along with his wife and 2 sons. In 2005, he was transferred to Udaipur and while he relocated, he visited his family every few weeks in Bhilwara.He added that in March 2005, one room in their house was let out to a man claiming to be Samir Prajapati, who started a vegetable business there. “In November 2005… it was the end of the month, I received a call in Udaipur from my wife. She said that Samir has been arrested and that his real na-me was Tulsiram. The police told her that he was wanted for murder,” witness told the court. Son, who was present at the time of Prajapati’s arrest in Bhilwara in 2005, told the court that towards the end of Nov.2005,Prajapati was residing at their home.

In his suicide note, the farmer has mentioned the debt and wrote, “I am committing suicide due to the loan burden and Modi Govt   is responsible for my suicide.”50-year-old farmer Shankar Bhaurao Chayare, a father of three daughters, swallowed pesticide in his village Rajuwadi of Ghantanji taluka, Yavatmal. According to reports, Chayare first tried to hang himself but could not succeed in doing so, then he swallowed pesticide to give up his life. Soon, he was rushed to the Govt   medical college at Yavatmal, but doctors declared him dead at 1.30pm on Tuesday.Yavatmal district is infamous for most farmers suicide. In Sept.2017, a farmer named Prakash Mangaonkar committed suicide after writing “Modi Sarkar” and “Suicide of Debt” on 2 leaves which were found along his dead body. Chayare urged state’s CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir for looking after his family member.Following his death, villagers under alleged leadership of activist Devanand Pawar surrounded the Ghatanji Police Station and raised demand to file an FIR against Narendra Modi. The protestors refused the post-mortem of deceased Chayare until the case is registered.Pawar told Indian Express, “The villagers are determined not to allow post-mortem till the offense is registered. A case of at least abetment to suicide can be immediately registered since the farmer has nearly named Modi to be the man, who has forced him to commit suicide. Don’t the police register such offenses in general in cases where the abettor’s name is mentioned in the suicide note?” TCN Fascism, Aadhaar, Demonetisation and Justice Loya: Arundhati Roy raises concerns about state of the country http://www.timesnownews.com/mirror-now/article/fascism-aadhaar-demonetisation-and-justice-loya-arundhati-roy-raises-concerns-about-state-of-the-country/215788 Booker Prize awardee Arundhati Roy has raised serious concerns about the ‘political dictatorship’ within the country and has urged political thinkers to come together and think of a solution to prevent the dark future staring at the country. “Today, we are living in a situation of extreme communalisation. So, each time we are made to divide ourselves in all sorts of way—along cast, gender, community, ethnicity, language,” said Roy during the first state congress of the Civil Liberties Committee – Telangana on Saturday, according to TOI.She was addressing a session called ‘Hindu fascism and democratic rights’. She also came down heavily on the BJP’s demonetisation move and termed it as “an act of fascism, of a kind that has never been done before ever, anywhere”. TOI reports that the activist author also termed Aadhaar as a new form of surveillance and spoke about how “every individual of a whole nation” is being controlled by this new form of surveillance. She also said that this is leading India on the path of “micro-fascism” and highlighted the oppression of Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis. She also brought up the death of Justice Loya under suspicious circumstances and believes that the Supreme Court’s failure to take an action was unsettling. timesnownews Manmohan Singh: Atrocities against minorities, Dalits increasing; could harm democracy if unchecked http://indianexpress.com/article/india/manmohan-singh-atrocities-against-minorities-dalits-increasing-could-harm-democracy-if-unchecked-5133158/ Chandigarh:Former PM   Dr. Manmohan Singh has insisted that atrocities against minorities and Dalits were on the rise in the country and warned that such incidents could harm democracy if unchecked.

He said the Govt   is in the process of “setting up a committee” to discuss adopting NCERT over the state board.Speaking at the first NITI Aayog meet for the Northeast, Deb said he wants quality education and not quantity, considering Tripura’s literacy ratio of 95 % , which is among the country’s highest. In his speech at the Northeast forum, Deb emphasised the importance of “education for all and health for all.”BJP swept Tripura polls last month and ended 25 years of Communist rule in the state winning 43 of 59 seats.“When I say education, I mean quality education and not just numbers.Communists only wanted the people of Tripura to study Mao (Zedong) and forget our Hindu kings. They removed Mahatma Gandhi from textbooks in Govt -run schools. I am going to implement NCERT syllabus in all these schools which will also have chapters on Tripura’s history,” he said.According to Deb, textbooks of Class IX-XII in Tripura featured the Russian and French revolutions, while some had pages devoted to the birth of cricket in England, Nazism and the rise of Adolf Hitler.“Students were being taught Karl Marx and Hitler but nothing about Indian freedom fighters,” he said. Officials also said that references to Rani Laxmibai and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose were also absent from textbooks as were chapters on the Constitution.indianexpress India’s membership to NSG: Delhi works on Beijing to drop objections on n-club entry http://indianexpress.com/article/india/indias-membership-to-nsg-delhi-works-on-beijing-to-drop-objections-on-nuclear-suppliers-group-club-entry-5132252/ New Delhi:Emboldened by its entry into three of the four multilateral export control regimes over the last two years, India on Tuesday once again reached out to China and tried to convince the interlocutors in Beijing to lift their objections at Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).

According to police, the clashes spread on Monday after pictures of the injured went viral on social media. In the wake of these rumours, an autorickshaw was set ablaze by some unidentified people at around 11pm in the Rangikhari point area, police said.In the last two days, the entire town has come down as clashes broke out in different parts of the Assam.

Apart from (at last count) 14 responses in this newspaper, there has been an array of critical commentary in social media and in other newspapers and websites.”“My comparison was ill-chosen, and the chastisement I received for it is merited. I also agree that the headscarf and the skull-cap are akin to the turban and the vibhooti, markers of religious identity that should not offend anyone when displayed in public,” he writes.In the 24th March article, Guha had written: “Many people, this writer among them, object to Hindus flaunting saffron robes and trishuls at rallies. While a burka may not be a weapon, in a symbolic sense it is akin to a trishul. It represents the most reactionary, antediluvian aspects of the faith. To object to its display in public is a mark not of intolerance, but of liberalism and emancipation.”In the new article, after admitting his comparison between Burka and Trishul was ill-chosen, Guha, however, wrote that he agrees entirely with Dr BR Ambedkar that “the burka is a mark of suppression, of women from men, and also of separation, of Muslims from non-Muslims. If you hide your face from me, how can we be partners in a shared political project? The burka is deeply inimical to fraternity, a quality that Ambedkar emphasised was vital to the creation of a democratic society.”Caravan Daily Adani’s Jharkhand Plant an Attempt to Prop up Struggling Australia Project: Report https://thewire.in/energy/adanis-godda-plant-an-attempt-to-prop-up-struggling-australia-project-report New Delhi: Adani Group’s Godda power project in Jharkhand may be a “financially unviable prop” due to the high price of Australian coal that it plans to use and the fact that its electricity will be too expensive for Bangladesh – which intends to buy power from the project under a long-term contract – according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a well-known US-based energy research body.The initial pact signed by the two sides apparently allows project developer Adani Power to pass on full fuel cost to electricity buyer (Bangladesh).Significantly, Adani’s mega power plant in Mundra, Gujarat too has become unviable due to the high cost of imported coal. After the Supreme Court rejected compensatory tariff for the project last year, the plant’s enterprise value has fallen drastically, rendering the investment dud. Adani group plans to ship coal from its Australian mine to fire the 1,600 MW Godda project in Jharkhand, which is currently under implementation. According to the IEEFA report, the delivered cost of coal supply for the project is estimated at $90-100 a tonne, which is on the higher side for the Indian power market.More crucially, the Godda power proposal appears to be an attempt by the Adani Group to prop up its struggling Carmichael coal project in Australia, while locking Bangladesh into an expensive, long-term and emissions-intensive source of electricity for decades to come, says the report.thewire Zuckerberg’s Facebook will do “everything” to ensure “fair polls” in India https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/international/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-will-do-everything-to-ensure-fair-polls-in-india Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the social networking giant would “do everything possible” to ensure fair polling in India and other countries, amid widespread allegations over the company’s alleged role in influencing the American presidential vote in 2016.

At least 230 people have died over that period.The figures compiled by the Guardian, which include an average of more than one death a week in 2017, are likely to be a substantial underestimate, as no part of the UK govt records homeless death statistics at a national level, and local authorities are not required to count rough sleeper deaths.According to the Guardian’s figures, the average age of a rough sleeper at death was 43, nearly half the UK life expectancy. Around 90% of those who died in the last 5 years were men, when the gender was provided.Experts have put the rise down to a rapidly increasing homeless population, rising rents, welfare cuts and lack of social housing, and have called for the Govt   to take urgent action to address the root causes of poverty.theguardian Adulterated alcohol kills 82 in Indonesia http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/adulterated-alcohol-kills-82-in-indonesia-118041101002_1.html Indonesian authorities said on Wednesday that the number of people dead from consuming homemade adulterated alcohol on Java island has increased to 82 and seven suspects have been arrested in relation to the incident.Deputy Chief of National Police Muhammad Syafruddin said in a Jakarta press conference that 51 people died in West Java province since Friday when the affected were taken to hospitals, Efe news reported.The other 31 dead were from the metropolitan area of the provincial capital Bandung, according to Jakarta police spokesperson Argo Yuwono.IANS Trump: US-Qatar ties 'work extremely well' https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/trump-qatar-ties-work-extremely-180410135820276.html                                  US President Donald Trump has praised his country's ties with Qatar as he welcomed the Qatari emir to the White House for talks on a number of issues, including the months-long Gulf diplomatic crisis.Speaking to reporters alongside Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Trump said on Tuesday that the US and Qatar \"have been great friends in so many ways\" and \"are working very well together\".\"We are working on unity in that part of the Middle East and I think it's working out very well; there are lot of good things happening,\" added the US president.aljazeera FLASH : VIEWS & NEWS Israel has killed Palestinian child every three days for 18 yrs, reveals shocking statistic https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180407-israel-has-killed-a-palestinian-child-every-three-days-for-18-years-reveals-shocking-statistic/ Kutch, Kathua and Unnao: Crimes against women rising under BJP?Priyanka Chaturvedi http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kutch-kathua-and-unnao-crimes-against-women-rising-under-bjp-5133088/ Why does BJP say ‘Beti Bachao’ and then do ‘Balatkari Bachao’ – over and over again?KAVITA KRISHNAN https://theprint.in/opinion/why-does-bjp-say-beti-bachao-and-then-do-balatkari-bachao-over-and-over-again/48905/ Kathua and Unnao: Handling of these two rapes makes a mockery of Nirbhaya protests:HARNIDH KAUR https://theprint.in/opinion/kathua-and-unnao-handling-of-these-two-rapes-makes-a-mockery-of-nirbhaya-protests/48565/ Bihar: Silence in NDA after attack on Minister Upendra Kushwaha: SOROOR AHMED https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/strange-silence-in-nda-after-attack-on-union-minister-upendra-kushwaha-rlsp-chief \nCompiled and edited by Anwarulhaq (Released at: 8:27 PM ) \n",

      "text": "32 Indians to contribute in report on Climate Change \nIn a first, NASA is conducting a study of the world’s largest phytoplankton bloom in the North Atlantic to see how the tiny sea critters influence the climate in every season. The North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) mission began its fourth and final deployment, which will study how phytoplanktons give rise to small organic particles that leave the ocean and end up in the atmosphere, ultimately influencing clouds and climate. \nIt is the first research mission to conduct an integrated study of all four distinct phases of the world’s largest phytoplankton bloom. “Most scientists studying the bloom head to sea during its climax in late spring and early summer. We did that, but we also went out during the other seasons to fully capture the minimum and transitions of the bloom,” said Rich Moore, Deputy Project Scientist at NAAMES. \n“This thoroughness pays off as our ship-based scientists use these data to fully describe the entirety of the plankton bust/boom cycle,” Moore said. “No one has done this before, and we’re excited about the science findings that are beginning to trickle out now,” he said. NAAMES research challenges traditional ideas about bloom dynamics and species succession. Findings from three deployments have already confirmed a distinct shift in the annual cycle of the phytoplankton bloom and researchers have noted a clear lack of larger-sized plankton during the peak of the bloom. \nDuring previous NAAMES deployments, researchers completed 220 research hours aboard an instrumented C-130 aircraft along specific tracks and manoeuvres over the North Atlantic, including fly overs of the Woods Hole Oceanic Institute’s (WHOI) Research Vessel Atlantis, which carries more than 50 researchers and crew members. The ongoing ship deployment is currently collecting observations of ocean biological composition and stocks, aerosol measurements and optical properties of the North Atlantic study area. Satellites such as CALIPSO, a joint NASA and CNES mission, also help to study the ocean and the atmosphere – from the depths of the phytoplankton bloom, to the clouds and atmospheric particles in the sky above. Findings from three deployments have already confirmed a distinct shift in the annual cycle of the phytoplankton bloom and researchers have noted a clear lack of larger-sized plankton during the peak of the bloom. (Image Source: NASA) \nThis final NAAMES study researches the ‘ascending transition’ of the bloom, which occurs after the phytoplankton minimum in February. In the March-April phase, the plankton are growing steadily, with their abundance in the water continuing to increase or accumulate toward the maximum of the bloom between May and July. This final NAAMES campaign provides a unique opportunity for researchers aboard Atlantis to do experiments that study growth and decay of the phytoplankton population. \n“For scientists watching the rates of growth, this is the exciting time, because the accumulation rate is expected to be going through the roof and stay high for the next few months,” Moore said. Rates of phytoplankton accumulation are critical for understanding the ocean conditions that lead to phytoplankton growth and its timing, a key to unlocking the environmental drivers and controls of biological dynamics. Since scientists are also interested in the link between the ocean, atmospheric particles and clouds, they have conducted meteorological balloon launches from the ship on a regular basis to capture information relevant to cloud formation processes. \nBy combining global data from NASA satellites with the ship, aircraft, and autonomous assets such as floats, along with laboratory research and balloon data, scientists are able to not only understand the current state of the atmosphere, but also how it is evolving over time.

      "text": "Dark matter may be a manifestation of extremely advanced alien life, researchers suggest Last updated on at 5:19 pm by Mihai Andrei \nOur limited understanding of dark matter and the fact that we’re focusing on the wrong things might be preventing us from discovering alien life. This collage shows NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope images of six different galaxy clusters, with the distribution of dark matter colored in blue. \nA Cosmic Gorilla \nYou know that experiment where you’re supposed to count the number of basketball passes , and you’re so focused on the ball that you don’t even see a bear moving through the picture? Researchers believe something similar might be happening on a cosmic scale. We’re so focused on one thing that we’re completely missing the other — and in this case, ‘the other’ might mean alien signals. \nWriting in the journal Acta Astronautica, neuropsychologists Gabriel de la Torre and Manuel García, from the University of Cádiz, say that when it comes to detecting alien signals, we might be looking in the wrong direction. They say that we’re looking for aliens that act similarly to us when that might really not be the case. \n“When we think of other intelligent beings, we tend to see them from our perceptive and conscience sieve; however we are limited by our sui generis vision of the world, and it’s hard for us to admit it,” says De la Torre, who prefers to avoid the terms ‘extraterrestrial’ or aliens by its Hollywood connotations and uses more generic terms, such as ‘non-terrestrial’. \n“What we are trying to do with this differentiation is to contemplate other possibilities,” he says “for example, beings of dimensions that our mind cannot grasp; or intelligences based on dark matter or energy forms, which make up almost 95% of the universe and which we are only beginning to glimpse. There is even the possibility that other universes exist, as the texts of Stephen Hawking and other scientists indicate.” \nThe awareness test that inspired the study. Try to count the number of basketball passes. Did you also catch something out of the ordinary? Hardwired to miss it \nIn order to test their hypothesis, they had 137 people distinguish aerial photographs with artificial structures (such as buildings or roads) from others with natural elements (such as mountains or rivers). In one of the images, a tiny character disguised as a gorilla was inserted to see if the participants noticed. As expected, participants tended to miss the gorilla. It’s normal because we’re hardwired to miss it — we’re looking for something else. Similarly, if we’re looking for a specific kind of signal, we might completely miss an unrelated type of signal, one we weren’t expecting. \n“If we transfer this to the problem of searching for other non-terrestrial intelligences, the question arises about whether our current strategy may result in us not perceiving the gorilla,” stresses the researcher, who insists: “Our traditional conception of space is limited by our brain, and we may have the signs above and be unable to see them. Maybe we’re not looking in the right direction.” \nIn another example presented in the article, researchers showed participants an apparently geometric structure that can be seen in the images of Occator — an impact crater of the dwarf planet Ceres , famous for its bright spots. Inside the crater appears a strange structure, looking like a square inside a triangle. The point researchers were trying to make is that we sometimes see patterns that just aren’t there, due to the way our brains are wired. \n“Our structured mind tells us that this structure looks like a triangle with a square inside, something that theoretically is not possible in Ceres,” says De la Torre, “but maybe we are seeing things where there are none, what in psychology is called pareidolia.” Image Credits: NASA / JPL-CaltechClose \nBut the opposite might also be happening, they say. We might have the signal right in front of our eyes, and simply miss it — kind of like a cosmic gorilla effect. Types of civilizations \nWe’re not really sure what to expect in terms of potentially advanced alien species, but the most commonly used scale is the Kardashev scale, proposed by Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev. The scale has three main categories, and it focuses on different stages of energy capture and use, which seems to be a vital requirement for an advanced species: A Type I civilization (a planetary civilization) can use and store all of the energy which reaches its planet from the parent star. A Type II civilization (a stellar civilization) can harness the total energy of its planet’s parent star and use it on a planet. A Type III civilization (a galactic civilization) can control energy on the scale of its entire host galaxy. \nIf you’ll look at it closely, you’ll see that humans aren’t really even on a Type I level yet, so the Kardashev scale has been extended, both upwards and downwards, including: A Type 0 civilization (humans) that harvests a significant part of its planet energy, just not yet to its full potential. A Type IV civilization (a universal civilization) that can control energy on the scale of the entire universe. This is already a virtually indestructible civilization. This hypothetical civilization would be able to interact with and harvest dark matter and dark energy. A type V civilization (a multiversal civilization) — this already steps into the realm of metaphysics and assumes there is more than one universe, and a civilization that’s able to span and populate several universes. A type VI civilization (deities) that would have the ability to interact with universes outside of time and space, similar in concept to an absolute deity. \nAlready, it’s becoming quite clear that we don’t even know how to understand very advanced alien civilizations, assuming that they exist. We might be able to understand a Type 0, I, or II civilization, assuming that they do share some similarities with us. But should we come across the higher levels of civilization, would we even realize what we’re looking at? This is what de la Torre and Garcia are asking. For all we know, dark matter and dark energy might hold the traces of such an advanced civilization. Of course, the researchers themselves admit the inherent shortcomings when you’re classifying something you know nothing about. \n“We were well aware that the existing classifications are too simplistic and are generally only based on the energy aspect. The fact that we use radio signals does not necessarily mean that other civilizations also use them, or that the use of energy resources and their dependence are the same as we have,” the researchers point out, recalling the theoretical nature of their proposals. \nThe duo also proposes a different civilization scale, with 3 types. Type 1 is essentially ours, ephemeral, vulnerable to a planetary cataclysm, either natural or self-made. Type 2 is characterized by the longevity of its members, able to explore galaxies and overall much more durable. Type 3, as you’d expect, would be constituted by exotic creatures with eternal or near-eternal life, with an absolute dominion over the universe. \nNaturally, this is all a bit speculative. We don’t really know whether we’re looking for the right thing or not, we don’t even know if there is a right thing or not. How likely are we to miss an alien signal, in the case that it exists? Impossible to tell right now. So this study definitely goes a bit ‘out there’, but it poses some intriguing questions. \nIf anything, the main takeaway is that we should perhaps take a step back and reconsider what alien life might look like. In other words, we shouldn’t only be counting the passes — we should keep an eye out for any gorillas. \nJournal Reference: Gabriel G. De la Torre, Manuel A. Garcia.

Not 50 or 100, the month-long camp for children from Classes 6 to 10 has 500 participants this time around. \nLike always, there is a good mix of things lined up for students – theatre, painting, music – Naadanpattu, Mappilapattu, poetry, story-telling, games show, competitions, quiz, and science, not to mention face-to-face with various personalities, talks on health and music and agriculture, and sessions on energy management, green protocol, and traffic awareness across three venues. But there are some other activities that promise to make the camp very interesting. \nOne is a play using puppets by Sunil Pattimattom. They will get to know what calligraphy is and how it is done. Children will also learn how not to let waste go waste and use it to make creative things. They will be taught how to use tender palm fronds to make innovative things. There will be sessions on origami, jewellery making, and on variety craft. \nChildren will also learn how to carve vegetables from a former chef at Mascot Hotel. They will also learn how to make an LED lab. To encourage reading among children, the library has arranged a session titled ‘Naam vayichirikenda pusthakangal.’ \nA session on script writing has been lined up as also one on direction. Children’s films will also be screened for the participants. The camp was inaugurated on Wednesday by Minister for Transport Mathew T. Thomas. A play ‘Poovankozhi Muttayittu’ by Rangaprabhath Children’s Theatre was held in the afternoon.",

      "text": "April 11, 2018 19:20 IST Updated: April 11, 2018 19:20 IST more-in \nThe government has decided to take over the Academy of Medical Sciences, Pariyaram, and the Kerala Cooperative Hospital Complex. \nThe State Cabinet, which met here on Wednesday, resolved to recommend the promulgation of an ordinance by the Governor for the takeover of the institution. The meeting also ratified the draft Bill for the takeover. \nThe Pariyaram Medical College Society had requested the government to take over the institution after it found itself difficult to carry on the administration. The previous LDF regime in 1997 had taken over the medical college but the subsequent UDF government returned the administration to the society. \nThe government has shouldered the burden of repaying the loan taken by the society for the medical college and hospital. \nHealth Minister K.K. Shylaja said the takeover was aimed at providing quality health care to the citizens in north Kerala. A press note quoting her said the medical college with 1,938 employees and 2,500 students would be an asset for the health sector in the State. \n“It is the first self-financing medical college in the cooperative sector and one of the best super speciality hospitals in India with 1,000 beds and 18 operation theatres as well as a dental college, pharmacy college, college of nursing, institute of paramedical sciences, Hridayalaya and public school within the premises.”",

Thode, \"Fire in California's Ecosystems\" 2006 | pages: 614 | ISBN: 0520246055 | PDF | 13,2 mb Fire is both an integral natural process in the California landscape and growing threat to its urban and suburban developments as they encroach on wildlands. Written by many of the foremost authorities on the subject, this comprehensive volume, an ideal text and authoritative reference tool, is the first to synthesize our knowledge of the science, ecology, and management of fire in California. Part I introduces the basics of fire ecology. It includes an historical overview of fire, vegetation, and climate in California; overviews of fire as a physical and ecological process; and reviews the interactions between fire and the physical, plant, and animal components of the environment. Part II explores the history and ecology of fire in each of California's nine bioregions. Part III examines fire management in California, including both Native American and post-European settlement; discusses current issues related to fire policy and management, including air quality, watershed management, invasive plant species, native species, and fuel management; and considers the future of fire management.

Misstear, \"Groundwater in the Celtic Regions: Studies in Hard-Rock and Quaternary Hydrogeology\" 2001 | pages: 282 | ISBN: 1862390770 | PDF | 19,3 mb Special Publication 182. Groundwater in the Celtic Regions: studies in hard-rock and Quaternary hydrogeology. This is the first attempt to bring together the hydrogeological issues facing Celtic regions, and to describe the prevailing hydrogeological environments in these areas. Lessons from these geographical areas can be applied to solve problems in similar geological terrain elsewhere.The book covers the diverse range of hydrogeological environments that occur in the Celtic regions of Britain and Ireland. These include hard-rock aquifers of Lower Palaeozoic and Precambrian age, generally dominated by fracture flow within a shallow zone of weathering; Carboniferous limestone aquifers, often characterized by conduit flow in karstic systems; dual-porosity Permo-Triassic sandstone aquifers; and Quaternary deposits, many of which form important shallow granular aquifers. The book addresses a number of current issues common to the Celtic regions, including: groundwater protection policies, groundwater management in karst aquifers, groundwater development in Quaternary aquifers, groundwater evaluation in data-scarce aquifers and groundwater supplies to small island communities. Readership: Hydrogeologists, environmental scientists and water engineers working in the Celtic regions. Practitioners involved with solving problems in hard-rock and Quaternary hydrogeology. Suitable for postgraduates in hydrogeology and environmental science.

This is the first time that the instant messaging application is going to appoint a head in the country. The vacancy is for a senior-level designation for somebody who can \"lead our (WhatsApp) efforts in India including products for people and businesses along with our interest in peer to peer payments.\" The India head will be based in Mumbai and will report to WhatsApp's Chief Operating Officer in California. \nWhatsApp holds a global user base of 1 billion strong, while it has 200 million monthly active users in India as on February 2017. \n\"This is a senior leadership position that requires product experience as well as a track record of success leading partnerships and business development in India. This leader will need to build a close partnership with product and engineering teams to influence direction and to effectively represent WhatsApp's long term strategy,\" a job advertisement on WhatsApp's website. \nComing to responsibilities, the WhatsApp India head will be required to shape and direct the messaging app as a product; represent WhatsApp's product strategy in country and drive alignment with partners and stakeholders; lead partnership efforts in market, acting as a cross functional leader across WhatsApp and Facebook teams; build relationships with key partner, and other constituents at senior levels. \nRegarding qualifications, WhatsApp is looking for someone with at least 15 years of experience in product driven companies and more than five years of experience with payment technologies in India. The aspiring WhatsApp India head must have a Bachelor of Science or Master of Science degree in Engineering, Sciences or Business and should be a \"heavy user of WhatsApp's products.\" \nWhatsApp wants its India head to coordinate with product and engineering leaders as well as negotiate and build relations with partners. \"You should also expect to handle day-to-day operations to support your team's efforts with key partners in market, develop and execute on strategic partner initiatives and build relationships with other key constituents in market and within Facebook,\" the WhatApp advertisement read. \nGoing by the advertisement, WhatsApp is looking for a candidate that can work on its recent rollouts in India - WhatsApp Business and WhatsApp Payment. WhatsApp is rolling out its UPI-based payments feature in India which has faced criticism from other players in the sector. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma has bashed the payment platform of WhatsApp on account of probable security risk for users and not complying with the guidelines. The new India head will have to work with the new WhatsApp Payments platform as well as brave criticism and competition in Indian market. \nMoreover, WhatsApp plans to make a senior level appointment is one of their biggest markets amidst rising concern over data privacy.

The intention is to keep them suitable for public display at a funeral, for religious reasons, or for medical and scientific purposes such as their use as anatomical specimens. [1] The three goals of embalming are sanitization, presentation and preservation (or restoration). Embalming has a very long and cross-cultural history, with many cultures giving the embalming processes a greater religious meaning. Specific uses are: sanitization, presentation and preservation (or restoration). The type of embalming powder depends on the purity and colour.

I want to share my weight loss story with you, Brian. \nSince having my first child, I’ve been carrying around an extra 30 pounds. I’ve tried many diets and couldn’t make anything work. Your diet just made sense and showed me that everything I was doing before was wrong and a waste of my time. \nThe 3 Week Diet plan was so refreshing and so simple to follow. I did everything you said and lost 23 pounds in the first three weeks. I’m now starting the diet again to lose 7 more pounds. You have changed my life, and I am incredibly thankful.” \n“I purchased your 3 Week Diet program before Christmas and started it on January 21. I found the book to be very informative and easy to read. \nI’ve lost 17 pounds in 12 days, I’m just concerned that I’m losing too much weight, too quickly. I will admit I haven’t followed the guide exactly. I’m not sticking perfectly to the listed foods and meal plans (but mostly) and doing very little exercise, but the weight keeps flying off. \nIt clearly works and if I’d followed it exactly I think it would scare the living daylights out of me because of the amount that I’d lose . So thanks again for the information. I’ve never purchased anything like this before because they are usually full of trash, but 3WD has been a pleasant surprise. Plus my girlfriend can’t get enough of my new body! “ \nI’ve lost 5 kilos in my first week. It’s my 10th day and I have included salad with some protein (eg. egg/ lean chicken) as you suggested. After 4 years of trying, the fat is finally coming off. It truly feels like magic! \nThe Introduction Manual is more than just an introduction to the diet. Instead, it discusses the science behind how we gain and lose weight as well as what absolutely needs to be done to attack that stubborn body fat that, until now, has been so challenging to get rid of. \nIn addition to this, The Introduction Manual will discuss the specific nutrients the body needs for this diet to be ultra-successful and the science behind those nutrients, and how they help you lose fat, increase metabolism and become much more healthy and energetic. \nThe Diet Manual is where the “rubber meets the road.” This is the definitive guide on how to lose weight in 3 weeks. Unlike those “one-size-fits-all” diets, The 3 Week Diet Manual will show you how to calculate your lean body mass vs. fat percentage, and will then provide you with a specifically tailored rapid weight loss plan to suit your body type. You’ll know exactly what to eat every day, how much to eat and when to eat it. You’ll never be guessing – just follow the outline and you WILL lose weight with this 21 day diet. \nIn addition to this, you’ll discover the exact foods you must eat to maximize your body’s fat-burning potential and what foods you must avoid at all costs because of their ability to slow down or even stop the fat-burning process. \nThe Diet Manual is, quite frankly, the ultimate method for producing extremely fast fat loss results. And it doesn’t stop there. Also included in The Diet Manual is my ultimate, super-simple plan for keeping the weight you’ve lost OFF forever, while still being able to enjoy your favorite foods. This allows you to live a “normal” life without worrying about the weight coming back (you’ll love this!). \nWhile The Diet Manual alone will produce truly amazing amounts of fat loss, The Workout Manual can help you to nearly double your results. This was specifically designed for those who don’t have time to go to the gym every day—but it also includes a gym workout for those who do. And even if you don’t like to work out, I’ve developed an exercise program that provides “no excuses” because they take just 20 minutes a day, 3-4 days per week. \nThe simple fact is, exercising for fat-burning is not about spending hours in the gym everyday. This is because fat loss is dependent on intensity — not time. Yes, it’s true you can lose weight spending an hour or so on the treadmill — but you’re never going to get rid of the stubborn body fat that way. The key to smashing fat-loss plateaus lies in short and intense, full body exercises that get every muscle in your body metabolically active. \nWhen you add a quality workout program with The 3 Week Diet, you truly have the ultimate “knockout punch” for extremely fast fat loss. The Workout Manual also includes my ultimate Midsection Miracle Workout, which contains the only two abs exercises you will ever need if you desire a set of 6-pack abs. Many have said that this exercise alone is worth much more than the price of my system! \nEvery great success starts with a decision to change your mindset. It’s your mindset and your internal motivation that get you the physical changes you want to see. This manual will give you the techniques to focus on your goals and remain motivated throughout The 3 Week Diet and beyond into your everyday life. \nThe Mindset & Motivation Manual includes a ton of high-quality and usable mindset and motivational tips, tricks, tools and secrets to not only get the ball rolling, but to ensure you stick with your diet and keep all your lost weight off forever! \nNow, I’m not going to insult your intelligence or risk my reputation by making some outlandish claims that in 21 days you’re going to have a set of 6-pack abs or be 50 pounds lighter than you are today without any effort… \nBut what I am going to promise you is this: \nIf you dedicate yourself over the next 21 days and follow The 3 Week Diet as outlined, you will be walking around with 12 to 23 pounds of body fat gone from your waist, hips, thighs, belly and butt. Your clothes will be looser, you’ll look healthier and more attractive…and you’ll have more energy than you’ve ever had in a long, long time. \nJust click on the Add To Cart button below and download the entire 3 Week Diet system. It can be in your hands in less than two minutes from right now. And to be perfectly honest with you, clicking that button is literally the difference between looking and weighing the same as you do right now…or being up to 23 pounds lighter in just 21 days. \nGo ahead and read through the manuals, commit to your 3 week diet plan and really put it to the test. I promise that you’ll be truly amazed at the results you can actually see in just a matter of days. And again, if The 3 Week Diet isn’t everything I promised, simply let me know and I’ll refund every single penny of your investment into the system — no questions asked. \nI truly look forward to hearing about your weight loss success using my new 3 Week Diet system. \nPlease send your comments, testimonials, success stories and questions about how to lose weight in 3 weeks to me personally at: brian@3weekdiet.com \nClickBank is the retailer of products on this site.

      "text": "Environmental Science and Technology Symposium hosted by the American Chemical Society at Shiv Nadar University EDUCATION news Environmental Science and Technology Symposium hosted by the American Chemical Society at Shiv Nadar University Published On: 11   11 Apr 2018 Greater Noida: Shiv Nadar University , one of India’s leading research-driven, multidisciplinary private universities, hosted an Environmental Science & Technology Symposium on April 7, 2018 organized by the American Chemical Society publications. The day-long forum featured scientific lectures from 17 world-class researchers from India and the United States engaged in a rich day of innovative and scientific exchange in the environmental sciences. Dr. David Sedlak as an editor-in-chief of ES&T and ES&T letters led the symposium. Earlier in the week, he taught the program of Water Science and Policy in the Center for Public Affair and Critical Thinking (C-PACT). Multi-disciplinary post-graduate (M.Sc.) program on Water Science and Policy aims to be a first-of-its-kind academic program that captures the multi-disciplinary nature of water, delivered by some of the best minds globally – experts on water who have worked on ground realities, made policies and initiated change. The main aim of this program is to create a critical mass of water professionals with a historically and socially contextualized, multi-disciplinary perspective and understanding of water, who can help carry forward India’s on-going paradigm shift in water management. Therefore, the program has been built on a modular structure, flexible enough to allow stakeholders from the government, civil society, industry and others to opt for selective courses from within the program, leading to the award of certificates and diplomas. There is array of options available in terms of both topics and duration – truly an opportunity for a diverse range of stakeholders in the water sector. Dr. Mihir Shah is the first President of the Bharat Rural Livelihoods Foundation, which supports innovative civil society action in close partnership with state governments. He is Distinguished Visiting Professor, Shiv Nadar University, where he is designing a globally first-of-its-kind Masters Program on Water Science and Policy. Dr. Shah addressed audience on his life’s work all over the world from Stanford University to the World Bank in Washington, the OECD in Paris, the Arctic Circle in Iceland, Chatham House and University College, London, UNESCO-IHE at Delft, International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Austria, International Water Management Institute in Colombo and the Singapore Water Week. He was the Keynote Speaker at the Global Water Summit at Rome in 2012 and the International EcoSummit Congress at Montpellier in 2016. American Chemical Society Publications and Environmental Science & Technology proudly announced the Environmental Science & Technology Symposium at Shiv Nadar University. The full-day forum featured scientific lectures from 17 world-class researchers from India and the United States. Attendees also had the opportunity to network with the ACS Editors and speakers. The program was free but registration was required to attend the symposium.

      "text": "No, Buzz Aldrin Didn’t See A UFO On His Way To The Moon April 11, 2018 0 \nBuzz Aldrin, second man to land on the moon believed the crew saw an extraterrestrial spacecraft. \nWashington: The view from the lunar landing module on July 20, 1969, was – in mankind's best guess – the first time a living being traveled to another celestial body to observe the luminous blue planet shrouded in the seemingly infinite darkness of space.But before that moment, the crew of Apollo 11 hurtling toward the moon radioed mission command in Houston to ask about a curious object they saw on their third day in space.\"Do you have any idea where the S-IVB is with respect to us?\" commander Neil Armstrong asked, referring to the third stage of the Saturn V rocket that was jettisoned earlier in the flight.Mission control had an answer about three minutes later, according to a NASA radio transcript of the mission.\"Apollo 11, Houston,\" the command replied. \"The S-IVB is about 6,000 nautical miles from you now. Over.\" That satisfied Armstrong, who said 12 seconds later: \"Okay. Thank you.\"The seemingly innocuous exchange has become a touchstone for UFO-sighting enthusiasts and alien truthers, and now, seemingly fake news.Buzz Aldrin, 88, the second astronaut to set foot on the moon, believed that the crew saw an extraterrestrial spacecraft at this moment, and a \"lie detector\" test proves it, at least according to the British tabloid the Daily Star. That's not quite right.\"He has never said he saw a UFO. This story has been a fabrication for the sake of headlines and is not true as far as Buzz Aldrin is concerned,\" his spokeswoman, Christina Korp, told The Washington Post in a statement Tuesday. That echoes Aldrin's 2015 comment on Reddit that the object \"was not an alien.\" The Daily Star did not return a request for comment.The truth is out there, if only the Daily Star looked closely.The tabloid's story focuses on a vocal analysis conducted by the Ohio-based Institute of BioAcoustic Biology and Sound Health, a nonprofit institution that founder Sharry Edwards has said developed a program that can evaluate how truthful or confident someone feels about a subject they are talking about.Edwards told The Post she used Aldrin's interview from the 2006 Discovery Science made for TV-documentary \"Apollo 11: The Untold Story\" to analyze Aldrin's remarks.\"There was something out there that was close enough to be observed and what could it be?\" Aldrin recounted about the incident, adding that crew member Michael Collins viewed ellipses on the L-shaped object when viewed through a telescope. \"That didn't tell us very much,\" he said.The moment called for restraint from theorizing what the object might be during one of the most scrutinized missions in human history, Aldrin said.\"Who knows what somebody would have demanded that we turn back because of aliens or whatever the reason is,\" he said on the program. The crew decided to move on and mention it later in mission debrief, Aldrin added.In an analysis, Edwards says Aldrin \"has a firm belief in what he saw but logical awareness that he cannot explain what he saw; therefore he thinks he should be doubted.\"She said the conclusion was published years ago but that she does not know how it became suddenly relevant.Aldrin has already clarified his position on the incident.In a response on the NASA website after the documentary was released, Aldrin said he believed he saw one of four panels separated from the S-IVB heading on the same trajectory toward the moon but on a slightly different course. That discussion was edited out and the rest was \"taken out of context,\" NASA said.In the 2015 Reddit thread, he said the sun must have glinted off one of the panels.The recurring UFO story is the result in part of the public distorting the scientific term UFO to mean a craft with \"little green men,\" NASA chief historian Bill Barry told The Post.Yet the Apollo 11 mission was already a significant moment in human history without the intrigue of alien spacecraft.The median age of Americans is about 38, or 11 years younger than the mission itself. Most people alive today were not around to hear President John F. Kennedy say in 1961 that the United States would send a man to the moon and return him safely to Earth.The Soviet Union had already been the first to send a man into Earth orbit, frustrating NASA and creating a belief that the Russians might have an edge. The stakes were high. \"They were basically on a war footing,\" he said of NASA leadership.NASA's lessons from the mission were extensive. For instance, leaders honed the organization for large scientific projects, which later helped develop the International Space Station, Barry said. And investment in science paved the way from everything from the internet to cellphones.Discoveries also offered more hints about the origin of life on Earth and the history of the universe. Evaluating the rock samples from the moon helped confirm theories that the body is the result of an object that smashed into the Earth and later coalesced to form our satellite, Barry said.That lesson amounted to a common refrain among astronauts, he added: \"We left the Earth and what we discovered was ourselves.\"In the next five centuries, humanity will remember the 20th century for three things, Barry said – two world wars and the U.S. landing on the moon.Aldrin has been known to defend that history, now and in the past.In 2002, filmmaker Bart Sibrel confronted Aldrin, demanding that he swear on a Bible that the landing was authentic. Sibrel called him a \"coward and a liar.\"Sibrel was adding \"thief\" when Aldrin struck him in the face. No charges were filed.The moment was captured on video. There were no camera tricks. The punch was real.",

      "text": "Four civilians, soldier killed in Kashmir gunfight \nIANS Srinagar, April 11 (IANS) Four civilians and a soldier were killed on Wednesday as a gunfight between militants and security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam district sparked off violent street protests and a call for a two-day shutdown in the Valley. Sepoy S. Gunakar Roy was killed when militants hiding in a house in Wani Mohalla in Khudwani area fired at security personnel closing in on them. Two other security personnel were wounded in the fighting. \nThe security forces fired back in a bid to capture the militants, said to be linked to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). \nAs the fighting raged, hundreds of people poured out of their homes and attacked the security forces with stones. The security personnel opened fire. \nDoctors named the civilians who died as Aijaz Ahmad Palla, 30, who had a gunshot injury, Faisal Elahi, 15, Bilal Ahmad Dar, 17, and Sharjeel Sheikh 28. \nPolice issued a statement saying the civilian deaths took place as a result of crossfire between the militants and security forces. \nThis was strongly contested by locals who assert that the civilians were shot dead by the security forces determined to break up the street protests. \nIn the end, the troops fired explosives to destroy the house where the militants had been hidden but there was no word on how many guerrillas had been killed. Two other houses in the vicinity caught fire. \nPolice officials said the debris of the house were being cleared to trace the bodies of the militants. \nFour injured civilians have been referred to Srinagar for specialized treatment. Informed sources said over 40 civilians were injured in street clashes. The condition of two of them was said to be critical. \nAuthorities ordered the closure of all schools and colleges in Kulgam and Internet services were suspended in south Kashmir areas. \nA Station House Officer (SHO) sustained a head injury during clashes between the civilian protesters and the security forces in north Kashmir's Baramulla town. \nSimilar clashes also erupted in north Kashmir's Sopore town as news about the deaths of civilians in Kulgam spread. Unrest also gripped Anantnag, Pulwama and Shopian towns. \nStudent protests rocked Kashmir University in Srinagar, the Islamic University of Science and Technology in Awantipora in south Kashmir and Degree College in Bandipora in north Kashmir. \nMeanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Chairman Yasin Malik was detained soon after he and separatist leaders Syed Ali Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq called for a two-day shutdown in the Kashmir Valley on Thursday and Friday to denounce the Kulgam killings. \nWhile Malik addressed the media in person, Geelani and the Mirwaiz spoke to the journalists over telephone. \nAfter the press conference, Malik set out on a protest march but was detained, triggering more clashes between JKLF supporters and security forces in Srinagar.   11- ",

      "text": "Itanagar (Arunachal Pradesh), April 11 \n\nYak – the lifeline of pastoral nomads in high altitudes of the Indian Himalayan region – is facing the threat of gradually rising temperatures in the region. \nThe increasing trend of environmental temperature at high altitudes is resulting in heat stress in yak during warmer months of the year. This, in turn, is affecting the rhythms of physiological responses of the animal. Studies have shown that the average environmental temperature in the region has increased 1.5 percent in the past 25 years, with yearly incremental increase of 0.06 degree. \n\nYak is accustomed to very cold temperatures and can survive up to minus 40 degrees but finds is difficult when the temperature crosses 13 degrees. “Yak can efficiently conserve its body heat during cold weather conditions and has minimal body mechanism to dissipate heat by way of sweating. This makes yak more susceptible to heat stress,” explained Dr Vijay Paul, principal scientist at the ICAR-National Research Centre on Yak (NRCY), Dirang, while addressing a media workshop on climate adaptation here. \nThe animal alters its respiration rate not only in response to a changing need for oxygen but for regulating body temperature. Therefore, increased respiration acts as a predictor of heat stress, along with other symptoms like panting, reduced feed intake and higher intake of water. Noticing these indicators of heat stress, nomads have started own adaptation measures for their animals. \nClimatic variables such as rainfall, cold waves and temperature change has been studied for the two yak rearing districts of Arunachal Pradesh – Tawang and West Kameng. Since past meteorological data is lacking in this region, researchers from NRCY have collated information from Brokpa namads who are engaged in yak husbandry in Arunachal Pradesh. \nTwo other prominent nomadic communities engaged in yak rearing are Changpas and Dokpas in Ladakh, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh. The total yak population in six states in the Indian Himalayan region is estimated to be over 76,000. Globally, China – mainly Tibet region – has the highest numbers of yak. \n\n“Yak rearing is an eco-friendly livelihood for nomads who migrate to higher altitudes during summer and return to lower altitudes at about 3000 meters above sea level during winters. \nThis ensures that their animals remain in almost same ambient temperature all through the year. It helps minimize heat stress. This traditional migratory pattern is getting disturbed with changing weather patterns,” noted Dr Paul. \nBesides heat stress in animals, fluctuating temperature also affects growth and availability of fodder in alpine pasturelands. This, in turn, lowers productivity of the animals. Yaks provide nomads milk, fibre and meat. Milk production depends directly on the quantity and quality of forage in pasturelands. The long hair of yak have water-resistant properties and can be a good packing material. Nomads use yak hair to weave material for making tents. In addition to climate-related factors, there is a reduction in grazing areas and degradation of pasturelands due to various developmental activities as well. \nDr Paul said nomadic communities were taking several adaptive steps as duration and timing of migration was changing. There is proliferation of yak-cattle hybridization as well as diversification of herds. Yak rearing needs to be preserved as this is the only source of livelihood for nomads. This can be done by rejuvenating degraded pastures, improvinglivestock healthcare practices and providing feed supplements for yaks. “We also need to develop stains that are less sensitive to heat stress,” he added. \nArunachal Pradesh had prepared the state action plan on climate change in 2013. The five year plan period has come to an end but no adaptation projects have been taken up in thestate. The plan had components on adaptation measures for agriculture and animal husbandry sectors but there was no specific mention of protecting yak populations. \n“The plan was approved for Rs 6500 crore but no funds were received for its implementation,” said Omkar Singh, principal secretary, department of environment and forests, Arunachal Pradesh. \n“We are in the process of reviewing the state plan based on new inputs such as high resolution vegetation maps which have since become available,” added D. Dohu Robin, deputy director (environment) and programme coordinator. \nThe three-day workshop has been jointly organised by the Indian Himalayas Climate Adaptation Programme (IHCAP), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Centre for Media Studies (CMS), along with the state climate change cell.

      "text": "April 11, 2018 17:36 IST Updated: April 11, 2018 17:36 IST more-in Rohini M Godbole, Professor at the Centre for High Energy Physics at IISc, talks about Bengaluru as a centre for science in India and on bridging the gender gap in the scientific community \nIf I had to pick a science city in India, it would have to be Bengaluru. You just have to look at the vicinity of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), there is the Raman Research Institute, the National Centre for Biological Sciences, University of Agricultural Sciences, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), and there are also two centres of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. You simply have to think of the field of science and there’s an institute. \nThese different institutes have different gender profiles depending on their subject of study. Of course, some of them are research-oriented, some are teaching institutes and others, like the ISRO labs, which are more goal-oriented. \nI feel one reason why women have been successful in ISRO is because these labs are goal-oriented, that way your achievements are measured by how much you contribute to a well-defined goal and it’s not possible to take away credit where credit is due. \nThere aren’t as many women working in IISc. The working environment in a lab in such an institute is not necessarily gender-unfriendly, nor is it particularly gender-friendly. It is only now , after all these years, that we have got a good creche. Earlier, there were no particularly women-friendly policies. I am talking from the perspective of my move to the city over 23 years ago. \nPerhaps, we didn’t have such policies because the number of women was also small then, though there have been very capable women scientists who have done remarkable work. We still haven’t had a woman deputy director or a director who is a woman, maybe that’s because the numbers are still small. \nNow, of course, there has been change and we do have women as deans and chairpersons in various departments. What I am trying to say is that there has been no proactiveness about having a woman-friendly policy. That is my judgement, it is not anti-women but there’s a certain apathy which is now changing. \nOne of the biggest challenges women scientists face is an invisible bias. It is true as a woman there comes a time in life when they may have to bear children, often at the same time when they also have to get settled in their careers. \nIn the book Lilavati’s Daughters , that I co-edited, many women scientists advised the other members in their community not to feel guilty if they have to seek support to take care of their ‘responsibilities’. \nIn Bengaluru, the Indian Academy of Sciences runs various initiatives including mentorship programs for women. The National Institute of Advanced Studies runs special programmes to train women leaders. \nAnd what’s interesting about Bengaluru as a scientific community at large, is that there is now a lot of collaboration between the various institutes. Of course, it helped that the director of IISC, Satish Dhawan, was the ISRO Chairman for a long time. The industry-academia interaction has increased substantially, we have big international industry names now. That part is for the better. However the city infrastructure is bursting at the seams. The Bengaluru that we could take a stroll in at Lalabgh without worrying about junk on the side of the road has changed. Still the city has enormous potential which can be realised when all centres work in a cooperative manner. Even in terms of bigger national and international endeavours, I would like to see the different institutions in Bengaluru join hands more visibly than they are doing. \nAs told to Harshini Vakkalanka This column features the city through the eyes of a prominent Bengalurean",

      "text": "Tweet \nAn old villager dressed in a pathani suit, sitting on a khatiya with a red-coloured harmonium, is flanked by his son on the left, who is just about to play the dhol. His other son, in the shadow, is looking back at you intently. While browsing through Instagram' Explore section, I came across this photograph and immediately hit 'like'. It reminded me of a side-trip to Joshimath I had undertaken while exploring Uttarakhand. Waseem Syed @wsyedfineartphotography \nA cityscape captured at dusk, with entangled electricity wires spread across two buildings, seemed like a composition that was not well thought out and had a lot of scope for improvement, looked like it was shot in the bylanes of Bhendi Bazaar in Mumbai. \nA paan -maker engrossed in making the perfect concoction to be had after a heavy meal could have been a scene captured in Puraani Dilli. \nExcept that each of these photographs were taken across the border. One was taken in Shah Allahditta, Punjab, and the other two in Karachi, to be precise. It made me curious, and I followed the account which posted these pictures — @EverydayPak. \nWhile going through the grid of posts in this account, you will do a double take. Barring the photographs involving heavily decorated trucks, which are an extremely popular image and immediately make one think of Pakistan, most of the other photographs may as well have been shot in India. But it is great to learn about the story behind each of the photographs told by amateur photographers from across the border. \nAnas Saleem, an ex-cadet who is currently pursuing his Bachelors in Computer Science in Lahore started Everyday Pakistan (@EverydayPak) in mid-February this year, to showcase what life is like in Pakistan. \n‘Everyday’ accounts have become a refreshing sub-culture on Instagram. Most of them are journalistically-driven with the express purpose of telling the story of a place. On a platform that is filled with vanity photographs, ‘Sponsored’ posts and celebrity nonsense, 'Everyday' accounts cut through the clutter. \nWhile Saleem has been on Instagram since 2013, it was only recently that he came across 'Everyday' accounts such as Everyday Africa and Everyday Mumbai, which prompted him to search for an Everyday Pakistan account. He didn't find one, and would not wait for anyone. This Faisalabad-resident decided to create EverydayPak on 15 February this year. Within a month, EverydayPak has garnered over 1000 followers — no mean feat, considering the silly games the Instagram algorithm has been playing since the start of 2018. Smaha Jahangir @fictionography \n“The mission of this account is to showcase moments which may not be covered by the mainstream media and to build a community of storytellers within Pakistan. I believe that there are many accounts which post great photos, but they don't tell stories,” says Saleem over an email interaction. \nEven though he is the current curator of the account, he does take help from Anushe Noor, a young writer and columnist, who helps him with the context and captions which are part of every post. He hopes to increase the size of the team, as he does get a lot of inquiries via Instagram direct messages (DMs). Plans are on to have a genre-focused schedule on the account too. \nThe modus operandi to discover photographs to showcase on the Everyday Pakistan account is similar to the practice 'Everyday' accounts globally follow. “Basically, the hashtag for this account is #everydaypakistan. First, I search for the photos with this hashtag. However, I do receive photographs on our Facebook page and in DMs as well. Some photographers even tag our account in their photos, which helps with discovery,” says Saleem. \nWhile the account is being promoted within Pakistan by local photographers, he says that other 'Everyday' accounts have been really helpful as well. “Everyday Brasil, Everyday Everywhere and Everyday Mumbai have promoted Everyday Pakistan on their platform,” he says. Bilal Hassan @mystapaki \nStreet photography, which is the underlying leitmotif in a lot of 'Everyday' accounts, is a recurrent theme on Everyday Pakistan as well. On being asked about undertaking street photography in Pakistan in general, Saleem says that while it was relatively easy for the men, it wasn’t so for the women. That’s not to say that Everyday Pakistan doesn’t feature women photographers. A lot of times, street photography as seen through the lens of Western photographers, especially in the sub-continent, has mostly focused on cliched subjects. These are portraits of poor, homeless people or photographs of people which are shot without getting to know their stories. In Pakistan, as in India, this is primarily the case when it comes to representation of the country in international publications and news companies. \n“The Western media has been portraying Pakistan in a very diverse manner. Before I started Everyday Pakistan, I came across many accounts of foreign journalists who are working in the country, but they only show poor people in their photographs and stories. I think Pakistan is full of happiness and great people,” states Saleem. \nChirag Wakaskar has been the brain behind the Everyday Mumbai account, and every weekend, you will find the account promoting other 'Everyday' accounts from across the world. Speaking about Everyday Pakistan, Wakaskar says, “We do not see enough of Pakistan beyond politics and news coverage. This project is a great way of looking at the people there, particularly for us Indians. Much like India, Pakistan is also primarily looked through the eyes of Western photographers, and this project provides a fantastic platform for local photographers to grow.” \nSaleem has a lot of plans for the account, and wants it to be a collective for upcoming photographers from Pakistan. But he intends on taking it slow. Among some of the noteworthy Pakistani street photography-focused accounts that he recommends on Instagram are @mystapaki, @fictionography, @usman_zubair, @_the.lost.soul and @dawn_dot_com. Munazza Anwar @munazzaanwar \nWhen asked about where most of his non-Pakistani followers come from, the answer isn’t surprising. “Majority of Everyday Pakistan’s international followers come from India. Chirag Wakaskar, who handles Everyday Mumbai, is very kind and helps me a lot with suggestions,” says Saleem. And these Indian followers don’t just like the photographs; they go a step further. Recently, within hours of uploading a photograph of the Katas Raj Temple near the Chakwal region in Punjab, he received a curious DM. \n“I got a message from an Indian user who told me that she showed the photo of the Katas Raj Temple to her 85-year-old grandfather, and that he wished to speak to me. She shared her contact number and I promptly called her. She was very happy and connected me to her grandfather with whom I first started talking in English but eventually switched to Urdu and Punjabi,” reminisces Saleem. This former resident of Pakistan's Punjab shared stories from before 1946, when as a youngster, he used to visit the Katas Raj Temple. “He expressed a desire to come visit his hometown in Pakistan. But due to the political situation, it was difficult to procure a visa. That call really made my day, as I had the chance to reach out to someone across the border and make them happy,” he says. Anas Saleem @ianassaleem \nNo sooner did he this account on his Instagram Story, than he started getting messages from Indian users, congratulating him on the project. “I’m an Indian living in the US and want to let you know how much your account means to me. Getting to see these pictures is like seeing a part of my own body, that I could never have otherwise seen. Thank you,” reads one follower response. \nWhile there is no clarity on the ease of visa regulations any time soon, through his project, Saleem is surely re-connecting many like the 85-year-old grandfather to their roots. On being asked which place in India he would like to visit, if he had a visa, he chose Delhi. “In Pakistan, my favourite city is Lahore, and the capital of India is a lot like Lahore. So discovering the culture and architecture of Delhi would make for a great first India trip,\" he says. \nHopefully someday, Saleem will get a chance to visit India. Till then, he’s on a mission to win more hearts by showcasing Pakistan like no other account on Instagram. \n  17:20 PM",

      "text": "Home / Mumbai / Mumbai: Indrani Mukerjea discharged from JJ Hospital; forensic report claims overdose of anti-depressants Mumbai: Indrani Mukerjea discharged from JJ Hospital; forensic report claims overdose of anti-depressants — By PTI | Apr 11, 2018 05:09 pm FOLLOW US: Mumbai: Former media executive Indrani Mukerjea , arrested for the alleged killing of her daughter Sheena Bora, was discharged today from the J J Hospital and was taken back to the Byculla prison, a senior official said. Mukerjea, who was admitted in the state-run J J Hospital for the treatment of suspected drug overdose has been brought back to the jail, Inspector General (prisons) Rajvardhan Sinha told PTI. Her health condition is better, the hospital’s dean Dr S D Nanandkar said. Mukerjea, 46, was on April 6 admitted to the hospital, where she was brought in a “semi-conscious” condition from her cell in the Byculla Jail in south Mumbai. She subsequently underwent a series of medical tests. Her urine samples were sent for analysis at a forensic laboratory here and after receiving its report, the hospital authorities said she had an overdose of anti-depressants that were not prescribed to her. “The reports of her urine sample showed a significant increase in the level of benzodiazepine, a class of anti-depressants,” a doctor from the hospital had said, quoting from reports of the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina. The state prisons department earlier ordered an inquiry to find out how Mukerjea fell ill in the jail. The IG (prisons) will submit his report to the department after completing the inquiry. Mukerjea, the co-founder of INX Media, is the prime accused in her daughter Sheena Bora’s murder case. Bora (25) was allegedly killed and her body disposed of in a forest area in the neighbouring Raigad district in April 2012, according to the police. Mukerjea, her former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai were arrested for the crime. Rai had later turned an approver (prosecution witness) in the case. Share this Post:",

      "text": "Shocked over baby being crushed, HC pulls up cops Shocked over baby being crushed, HC pulls up cops Sagar Kumar Mutha | TNN | Apr 11, 2018, 11:37 IST Representative Image HYDERABAD: Wondering what else would shake the conscience of authorities other than the ghastly video of a newborn girl child being crushed to death minutes after her birth, the Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday made it clear that it wants stringent and quick punishment handed over to perpetrators of the crime. A quack in Gayatri Nursing Home at Saidabad is reportedly seen in the video killing the baby. A Bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi was dealing with a public interest petition filed by R Sandeep Yadav complaining of pre-natal diagnosis and female foeticide taking place in Gayathri Nursing Home, Saidabad. The petitioner submitted a pen drive with video footage which showed quack Sarwari Unrisa — who works at the nursing home — crushing a girl child with her bare hands. The Bench last week directed additional police commissioner of Hyderabad to investigate the matter and file an action taken report. The report merely said that a case was registered against Unrisa and Gayathri Nursing Home. The Bench frowned upon the ‘leisurely pace’ at which the additional commissioner was going forward with a case of such importance. The Bench directed the commissioner of police, Hyderabad, to entrust the case to a competent officer to exclusively probe and file an action taken report within one week. It said the the Hyderabad city police commissioner would otherwise have to be physically present before the court. The Bench was unhappy that the police chose to arrest the petitioner basing on a complaint by the hospital. “Something is wrong, they will arrest those who bring things to our notice,” the acting CJ fumed. He asked whether the video was sent to forensic science lab and whether the quack was arrested. The bench could not get replies for this. The additional police commissioner report makes no mention about efforts made to trace the quack, the Bench said. The state counsel said doctors themselves closed the hospital after reports about illegal sex determination tests and female foeticide. The bench directed authorities not to permit the hospital to open. The case has been posted for next week. Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App .

      "title": "Supreme Court pulls up Centre for not using Rs 90,000 crore meant for environment",
      "text": "Wednesday 11 April 2018 X The court also suspects misuse of funds as a recent affidavit showed that the money was being used for construction of roads, renovation of bus stands and science laboratories in colleges \nThe Supreme Court on Tuesday pulled up the Centre for not using around Rs 90,000 crore assigned for environment restoration. The apex court also upbraided the government for not utilizing this Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) fund for the right purpose. \n“It is very clear that the amount was used for purposes, other than what it was entrusted with. How far you want the court to go? We trusted the executive but they say they will do whatever they want,” the bench, comprising Justices Madan B Lokur and Deepak Gupta, was quoted as saying in media reports. \nThe Compensatory Afforestation Fund Act (CAF), 2016, under which the CAMPA has been set up, has a provision to collect funds from user agencies—any person, organisation, company or department of the central or state government making a request for diversion or de-notification of forest land for non-forest purposes. \nWhen the Additional Solicitor General ANS Nadkarni, appearing for the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), asked the court to tell the government what the fund can and cannot be used for, the bench replied that it could not be used for civic or municipal purposes. \nAccording to the CAF Act, the fund will be used for “compensatory afforestation, additional compensatory afforestation, penal compensatory afforestation, net present value, catchment area treatment plan or any money for compliance of conditions stipulated by the Central Government while according approval under the provisions of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980.” \nThe issue of the usage of CAMPA funds was raised when an affidavit filed by the chief secretary of Odisha showed that the money was being used for construction of roads, renovation of bus stands and science laboratory in colleges. “This money is meant for the benefit of the people. It is to be utilised for that only and not as a part of your governance. It is part of your job as a state. Construction of roads and installing streetlights is your job as a state. People's funds cannot be used for it. Your total expenditure for social cause is not even five per cent,” the bench told the counsel for Odisha. \nThe idea of compensatory afforesatiaon, which essentially means planting trees to compensate for undertaking an activity that leads to deforestation, has its roots in the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The ad hoc CAMPA body was created by the order of the Supreme Court on July 10, 2009. The ad hoc CAMPA was created as National Advisory Council under the chairmanship of the environment minister for monitoring, technical assistance and evaluation of compensatory afforestation activities. \nTill 2016, when the CAF Act was finally passed by the Parliament, compensatory afforestion and the fund collection was happening under the Compensatory Afforestation Fund guidelines released by MoEF in 2009. The Act was followed by the long-awaited rules, which came out in February this year. \nWhile now the entire legal apparatus for implementing compensatory afforestation is in place, the process is riddled with problems. Before the CAF rules were released this year, there were reports from various parts of the country where compensatory afforestation was being done in violation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA). \nMove from news to views and get in-depth reports on issues that matter to you, every fortnight.

      "text": "Wednesday 11 April 2018 X The increasing trend of environmental temperature at high altitudes is resulting in heat stress in yak during warmer months, also affecting the nomads who rely on yaks for livelihood Heat stress in yak is affecting the rhythms of physiological responses of the animal. Credit: ISC \nYak – the lifeline of pastoral nomads in high altitudes of the Indian Himalayan region – is facing the threat of gradually rising temperatures in the region. \nThe increasing trend of environmental temperature at high altitudes is resulting in heat stress in yak during warmer months of the year. This, in turn, is affecting the rhythms of physiological responses of the animal. Studies have shown that the average environmental temperature in the region has increased 1.5 per cent in the past 25 years, with yearly incremental increase of 0.06 degree. \nYak is accustomed to very cold temperatures and can survive up to -40 degrees but finds is difficult when the temperature crosses 13 degrees. “Yak can efficiently conserve its body heat during cold weather conditions and has minimal body mechanism to dissipate heat by way of sweating. This makes yak more susceptible to heat stress,” explained Vijay Paul, principal scientist at the ICAR-National Research Centre on Yak (NRCY), Dirang, while addressing a media workshop on climate adaptation here. \nThe animal alters its respiration rate not only in response to a changing need for oxygen but for regulating body temperature. Therefore, increased respiration acts as a predictor of heat stress, along with other symptoms like panting, reduced feed intake and higher intake of water. Noticing these indicators of heat stress, nomads have started own adaptation measures for their animals. \nClimatic variables such as rainfall, cold waves and temperature change have been studied for the two yak rearing districts of Arunachal Pradesh–Tawang and West Kameng. Since past meteorological data is lacking in this region, researchers from NRCY have collated information from Brokpa namads who are engaged in yak husbandry in Arunachal Pradesh. Two other prominent nomadic communities engaged in yak rearing are Changpas and Dokpas in Ladakh, Sikkim and Himachal Pradesh. The total yak population in six states in the Indian Himalayan region is estimated to be over 76,000. Globally, China – mainly Tibet region – has the highest numbers of yak. \n“Yak rearing is an eco-friendly livelihood for nomads who migrate to higher altitudes during summer and return to lower altitudes at about 3,000 meters above sea level during winters. This ensures that their animals remain in almost same ambient temperature all through the year. It helps minimise heat stress. This traditional migratory pattern is getting disturbed with changing weather patterns,” noted Paul. \nBesides heat stress in animals, fluctuating temperature also affects growth and availability of fodder in alpine pasturelands. This, in turn, lowers productivity of the animals. Yaks provide nomads milk, fibre and meat. Milk production depends directly on the quantity and quality of forage in pasturelands. The long hair of yak has water-resistant properties and can be a good packing material. Nomads use yak hair to weave material for making tents. In addition to climate-related factors, there is a reduction in grazing areas and degradation of pasturelands due to various developmental activities as well. \nPaul said nomadic communities were taking several adaptive steps as duration and timing of migration was changing. There is proliferation of yak-cattle hybridisation as well as diversification of herds. Yak rearing needs to be preserved as this is the only source of livelihood for nomads. This can be done by rejuvenating degraded pastures, improving livestock healthcare practices and providing feed supplements for yaks. “We also need to develop stains that are less sensitive to heat stress,” he added. \nArunachal Pradesh had prepared the state action plan on climate change in 2013. The five year plan period has come to an end but no adaptation projects have been taken up in the state. The plan had components on adaptation measures for agriculture and animal husbandry sectors but there was no specific mention of protecting yak populations. “The plan was approved for Rs 6,500 crore but no funds were received for its implementation,” said Omkar Singh, principal secretary, department of environment and forests, Arunachal Pradesh. \n“We are in the process of reviewing the state plan based on new inputs such as high resolution vegetation maps which have since become available,” added D Dohu Robin, deputy director (environment) and programme coordinator. \nThe three-day workshop has been jointly organised by the Indian Himalayas Climate Adaptation Programme (IHCAP), Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Centre for Media Studies (CMS), along with the state climate change cell. \n(India Science Wire) \nMove from news to views and get in-depth reports on issues that matter to you, every fortnight.

      "title": "Haryana Board Exams: Students try to woo examiners with shayari, jokes, couplets and money",
      "text": "If this was an examination to test their creativity, many of these students would have passed with flying colours. Not surprisingly though, their grades paint a very different picture. These are some students of class 10 and 12 in Haryana, who have tried cajoling, coaxing, even bribing their examiners to ensure they get at least passing marks.\nWhile some have penned couplets and shayari to impress their invigilators, others have used jokes to convince these teachers. As for some, they have simply attached Rs 100 and Rs 200 notes with their answersheets to 'overwhelm' the teachers. A few students have offered to throw a party for the evaluator, if he/she ensures that the student passes with good marks. The evaluation process is underway at four centres in Gurugram, Haryana with Hindi, English and Mathematics answer sheets being evaluated.\nYogesh, science teacher at Khandsa government school, informed that one of the copies had Ghalib’s shayari in it. Dipti, an English teacher at Jaikabpura School , shared that one of the sheets she checked said that she would get a party if the student passed, and that she would also get Rs 600. The student in question has been granted only six marks in the subject.\nOne of the students had answered the entire 30 questions in the exam with one shayari, stated Basai government school teacher Ashok Kumar. \"The student has been given zero marks in the exam paper,\" he added.\nAnother student has written in her exam paper, “Sir, please forgive me. My parents tell me that I’ll fail the exams. I have a lot of burden on me. If you could pass me in the exams, I’d be really grateful.”\nNo doubt, everyone has a good laugh while reading about these incidents but it also worries many examiners about the future of students who will stop at nothing to get some marks. Similar antics were noticed during the UP board exams some time ago.\nRead the story in Hindi here\n ",

      "title": "Bellandur: NGT raps Karnataka government, forms panel to inspect lakes",
      "text": "NGT notice to Centre, Uttarakhand on plea to protect hot springs \nThe National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday slammed the Karnataka government over its action plan on Bengaluru’s Bellandur lake and formed a committee to inspect the lakes in the city. A bench headed by NGT acting chairperson Justice Jawad Rahim said the report submitted by the state government was “incorrect and misleading” and was bereft of the actual action taken on the ground. \n“This is not what we expected from the state authorities. The action plan submitted by the state contains incorrect and misleading information. The report submitted by the state does not convince us. There has been default in compliance of the order of the tribunal. “We are not here just to read files and close them. Compliance of the order has to be done, Do you want us to call the Army for compliance,” the bench observed. \nThe green panel, which stopped short of imposing a fine on the state and its instrumentalities, formed a committee comprising senior advocate Raj Panjwani, a professor from Indian Institute of Science- Bangalore, a senior scientist from Central Pollution Control Board, the commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the secretary of Bangalore Development Authority and a lawyer to be chosen by the senior advocate. \nThe committee would inspect Agara, Bellandur and Varthur lakes lakes in Bangalore on April 14 and 15. The committee has been directed to submit a detailed report after conducting inspection of the lakes and inform the tribunal about the quantum of municipal solid waste generated by the apartments and other agencies in the vicinity of the water body. \n“The committee shall inform the tribunal about the extent of hydrophytes in the lakes along with the incidents of fire which have taken place till April 10, 2018, condition of treatment plants around the lake, if any, and whether the apartments have obtained the occupancy certificates from authority,” the bench said. Hydrophytes are aquatic plants that grow in or near water and provides cover for fish and other aquatic organisms. \nThe tribunal had earlier rapped the state for not removing weeds and macrophytes from Bengaluru’s Bellandur lake at regular intervals despite specific orders and directed it to submit monthly compliance reports. The tribunal had directed the state government to produce sufficient material proof of the action taken in this regard and posted the matter for hearing on April 11. \nOn January 29, the green panel had directed Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru to carry out a pilot study on the visible aquatic plants. “Considering the role of macrophytes in rendering the quality of water in lakes below acceptable levels, it is necessary that the macrophytes menace is terminated once and for all,” the NGT had said. \nEarlier, the green panel had come down heavily on the Karnataka government for not taking active measures to prevent recurring incidents of fire at the severely polluted Bellandur lake.

      "title": "How to lose belly fat?",
      "text": "LinkedIn 0 \nAre you struggling with belly fat? Do you feel that your arms and legs are toned but your belly is a large squishy bag of jelly? Then worry not, you are not alone. There are many like you who struggle with bad genes when it comes to where your body wants to store fat. For some, it is the buttocks, for some, it is thighs and for many like us, it is the abdomen area or the mid-section. So how can you get a flat belly? It can happen only when you reduce your overall body fat percentage, when you get your body fat percentage close to 20 per cent (for men 10 per cent). \nThe abs and slim waist will be visible only when your body fat percentage is at the lower side. Spot reduction is a myth. \nLosing weight and losing fat are two different things. You may weigh the same but might look leaner when you try to get a lower body fat percentage and more muscles. So always aim at fat loss or inch loss, then weight loss when you are aiming to lose the belly. Always try to gain or save those precious muscles. Your body will thank you for sure. \nThe BMI calculator can show you the ideal body weight as per your height, but it doesn’t consider many other factors like water retention, bone structure, sodium intake etc. that affect your weight that can fluctuate on a daily basis. So, technically BMI is not an accurate way to calculate your progress or to ascertain what the ideal weight for your body should be. Whereas fat measuring calipers show inch loss or Body Composition Analysis reports clearly show the muscle gains and the fat loss percentage which are much more reliable to measure your progress. So, it is important to lose the belly fat and take care of your health. \nNow the question arises, that how can you lower your body fat percentage? The process is simple and backed by science. Everything boils down to what you eat and how you exercise. \nEating: First try to calculate what is your daily calorie requirement? The standard 2000 calories don’t apply to all women. Get a BCA Report done. Using your lean mass value, calculate your TEE (Total Energy Expenditure) and BMR (Basic Metabolic Rate). BMR is the minimum calories required to sustain your body functions. Never go below your BMR. 800 calories diets are a fad. It harms more than it delivers. Once you have the BMR and TEE numbers, chalk out a Macro based eating plan using those numbers. Macros are Carbs, Proteins, and Fats. There are many online calculators that will help you to ascertain what should be the percentage of each of the Macros in your daily diet. Keep on increasing your calories every week till you reach a plateau. Unfortunately, our body adapts to low calories if on a diet for a very long time and stops losing weight. Stop taking sugar and switch to natural sweeteners. Start cooking your own meals if possible. Try simple intermittent fasting where the eating window starts at 12 noon and ends at 9 or 10 pm. It is sustainable. Prior to breaking your fast, you can have black tea/coffee/herbal teas. It’s okay not to have breakfast. Caffeine also helps in the fat burning process. Have lunch that doesn’t contain carbs to prolong the fat burning process in your body. Try salads, carb free chapatti (made from flaxseed powder, almond powder, coconut powder etc.) Make the first meal of the day rich in protein. Eat carbs allowed in your macro diet at night. Finish your dinner by 9 pm. Make sure to complete all your macros to get the maximum thermogenic effect. \n\nExercise: Lift weights 3 to 5 days in a week. Strength training is required to maintain and grow your muscles. Especially, when you are in a calorie deficit diet. Anything which is below your TEE is in calorie deficit. Muscles are required to raise your metabolism. No, weight training won’t bulk you up. Instead it will make you stronger and will make you look toned. Include cardio as well. 3 sessions of half an hour in a week are more than enough. For maximum fat loss, you can try HIIT. HIIT can be applied to any form of cardio like running, swimming, cycling, etc. In this case, you put full on blast of efforts for 30 seconds and then minimum efforts for 30 seconds which help you to somewhat recover. Do not underestimate steady state cardio. Walks and jogs are also helpful in shedding fat. Though the results are slow but you will eventually lose fat if you are consistent with your efforts. However, you need to invest at least an hour. If you hate burpees, don’t do it. Not all exercises are fit for everyone. As you age, you need to take care of your joints. But you can always try exercises that you enjoy like yoga, cycling, walking, dancing; with good music and varied approach, so that you don’t feel bored. The idea is to challenge your body but in a calculated way. \nIn the end, I would like to say is that don’t look for shortcuts. The ‘gharelu nuskhe’, the fat burners, will only work if your diet and exercise are on point. No magic pills, no masalas can get you into shape. The only way you can get there is by working towards your goal. \nAnd, most importantly, have patience. Give yourself time to change. Be consistent and stay disciplined. \nRemember that excess fat is a precursor to many critical illnesses and heart ailments. And such diseases come knocking at your door without a warning. In such a scenario, what’s important is to secure yourself and your loved ones financially with a health insurance. \nAbout Aegon Life: A joint venture between Aegon – world’s leading financial services and Bennett, Coleman & Company – India’s leading media house, Aegon Life Insurance launched its pan-India operations in July 2008.

Our experts uncover what to learn next. \nConstant learning is essential to your success as a technologist. But putting all of your eggs in one basket is usually not the best strategy. Instead of specializing more in the skills you already have, it’s also important to diversify and pick up adjacent technologies. \nWe asked our authors to weigh in on skill adjacencies for six top technologies, and how these adjacencies can complement other areas of expertise. Here’s what they told us. \nAngular \nMany Angular developers are taking advantage of RxJS, a sophisticated library (originally built by Microsoft) that provides observables to help you manage asynchronous operations. As with “the force,” the more you learn about observables and their many operators, the more powerful you can become with them. \n- Angular expert, Deborah Kurata \nPowerShell \nCloud computing patterns complement PowerShell. And I don’t mean host your stuff in Azure or AWS. I mean building data centers that follow cloud operator patterns. When you spin up a new VM in AWS, nobody is logging into some console and making that happen. It’s all automatic. That’s how our own data centers should be—all automatic. Once someone with authority approves a new deployment (a VM, a container or whatever) it “just happens.” So understanding the adjacent technologies that enable automation in your environment – things like CI pipeline stacks and so on – is important. \n- PowerShell pro, Don jones \nJava \nSpring 5 was released a few months ago, and with the advent of Optionals, Spring has completely rewritten their API to use Optionals that don’t throw NullPointerExceptions. This will help make code more stable, and it also enhances tooling to better foresee errors they need to handle. \nNewer languages on the JVM, such as Kotlin, are already using this syntax—and since they don’t have a legacy of doing it a different way, these languages seem to be gaining adoption rapidly. Scala is also adopting this approach, and that’s why some people feel it helps enforce best practices. \n- Java developer for 20+ years, Bryan Hansen \nHTML5 \nCSS is always the butter to HTML’s bread. There are many great things happening in CSS right now, especially in terms of layout. CSS Grid allows for native column-and-row-based layouts, without the need of a framework. Web designers and developers have been wanting this for years, which makes its implementation really exciting. \n- Web developer, Susan Simkins \nPython \nAt present, the most commonly cited reasons to learn Python are its applications in data science and software development. However, there really isn’t a field where you wouldn’t benefit from knowing Python. Python is used as an automation platform for several graphics and design applications. It’s an omnipresent language in cloud and datacenter operations. It’s used routinely in massive biological analytics applications like the Human Genome Project. It’s a common platform for robotics programming. So, Python itself can be consider “adjacent” in many ways. \n- Python pro, Jim Christopher \nScrum \nWhile a deep knowledge of the Scrum framework is critical for a Scrum Team’s effectiveness, there are also many complementary skills that can better enable a team’s success. Emotional Intelligence, commonly known as EI, allows an individual to better understand their emotions and the emotions of others, while also helping them understand how emotions may influence their interactions. Since the Scrum framework places an emphasis on collaboration across the Scrum Team, a properly developed sense of emotional intelligence is critical for keeping those interactions productive. \nScrum Teams also stand to benefit from exposing themselves to other agile methodologies, most notably, Kanban. Contrary to popular belief, Scrum and Kanban are not competitors, and they’re far from mutually exclusive. While the two methodologies do approach work in fundamentally different ways, both offer numerous complementary practices that can yield benefits in any environment. \n- Scrum expert, Jeremy Jarrell \nUncover where your skills stand in these technologies.

      "text": "Future look 6 top technologies Future look: 6 top technologies \n“The future of technology.” It’s a loaded statement. What will technology look like next year, or 5 years from now? How will your job change? Can you plan ahead? Apr 11th 2018 \n“The future of technology.” It’s a loaded statement. What will technology look like next year, or 5 years from now? How will your job change? Can you plan ahead? \nWhen it comes to questions like these, the experts are best at predicting what’s on the horizon. So, we’ve put together six expert opinions about what’s in store for some of today’s top technologies. From Python to PowerShell and Java to Scrum, here’s how you can expect the future to unfold. \nPYTHON \n“If Python isn’t everywhere, it will be soon. One of the biggest indicators I can find at the moment? Microsoft is considering adding Python support to its flagship Excel office product. Additionally, Python adoption is accelerating in key industries, due at least in part to the surge of interest in data science and machine learning —spaces where Python has become a staple technology. Looking at patterns of Stack Overflow queries across languages, the growth of Python is clearly being demonstrated.” \n- Python pro, Jim Christopher \nJAVA \n“With the release of Java 9, a host of enhancements have been added, including Optionals. And we are just now seeing the positive ripple effect Optionals are having on the API. Before Optionals, code could be quite brittle surrounding runtime exceptions and how to best handle errors. But as more developers embrace Optionals, I think we’ll start to see better APIs being developed. Other languages that run on the JVM, such as Kotlin and Scala, are already embracing this feature and it’s helping this adoption on new projects. In the past 18 months, there’s been a significant rise in the adoption of tools like Kotlin, and this is a direct reflection of how they have embraced this feature. \nWhile Optionals are a quick way to begin taking advantage of the enhancements Java 9 brings, there are also more complex features you should understand. The Stream enhancements in 8 and 9 are very complex features that tackle an even more intricate problem. If you haven’t taken the time to learn them, I recommend doing a sprint with these Stream enhancements just to understand the problems they fix and how you can apply them in the future.” \n- 20+ year Java developer, Bryan Hansen \nANGULAR \n“Angular continues to keep pace with important changes in modern web development, yet provides stability for developers, libraries and tools. It achieves both goals by implementing semantic versioning, a planned deprecation policy and clearly defined release cycles. That’s why developers can easily move from Angular 4 to 5 , for example, with little or no changes to their application. You can expect this goal of compatibility to continue, making it painless to migrate to future versions of Angular. If you want to build modern web applications, learning Angular is a step in the right direction. Begin with the basics to get a firm foundation and a conceptual overview of its features and capabilities. Then dive into more intermediate level topics to expand your knowledge and learn patterns for real-world development.” \n- Angular expert, Deborah Kurata \nPOWERSHELL \n“PowerShell is the future. Sure, small companies may not need a lot of automation, because that will increasingly be done for them through services like Office 365. Old, stodgy companies might simply refuse to go that way, but their IT overhead is going to become a competitive disadvantage soon. But, automation is a business reality, not just a convenience for IT people. It’s taking business leaders some time to understand and appreciate that, but now the momentum is there and they’re all going to start demanding it. \nI can imagine two reasons why someone might not learn PowerShell and other automation technologies. First, you may already have related skills, so you think you can ignore this one. Second, you could be afraid of change because the technology seems hard and you don’t want to risk failing. These reasons lead to a dead-end street for your career. PowerShell could be your key to a better job, a massively better salary and a better place in life.” \n- Powershell pro, Don Jones \nSCRUM FRAMEWORK \n“As adoption of the Scrum framework continues to surge, Scrum practitioners are encountering many interesting challenges. The biggest challenge they currently face is implementation of the Scrum framework at scale. Many organizations who initially began with small and lightweight Scrum pilot projects are now ready to capitalize on their success by promoting Scrum adoption to the rest of their organization. \nHowever, this doesn’t mean bigger and bigger Scrum teams, as you might expect. I nstead, adoptions of the Scrum framework are grown simply by increasing the number of small, cross-functional Scrum Teams, and then enabling them to work in concert in whatever way allows them to be most effective. As you can imagine, enabling dozens of teams to work collaboratively in an incremental and iterative manner yields many unique challenges, but the results can be dramatic. \nSo long as Scrum’s creators continue to evolve it to better meet the needs of today’s teams, it may remain the dominant methodology for agile teams and keep increasing the demand for qualified Scrum practitioners, especially Scrum Masters.” \n- Scrum expert, Jeremy Jarrell \nHTML5 \n“As one of the most fundamental building blocks of the web, HTML is a staple technology—meaning an understanding of it and how it will impact the future is key. \nShort term, the W3C plans to release a Recommendation in 2018, so we should see some new elements and improvements with 5.3. Following updates to the WHATWG Living Standard is a good way to get a pulse on what is being added and removed. Long term, HTML will need to evolve to meet the modern needs of web application developers and complex technologies like VR. So, paying attention now is crucial.” \n- Web developer, Susan Simkins \nUncover where your skills stand in these technologies. Use Pluralsight IQ to find out. Special Offer",

      "text": "Future look 6 top technologies Future look: 6 top technologies \n“The future of technology.” It’s a loaded statement. What will technology look like next year, or 5 years from now? How will your job change? Can you plan ahead? Apr 11th 2018 \n“The future of technology.” It’s a loaded statement. What will technology look like next year, or 5 years from now? How will your job change? Can you plan ahead? \nWhen it comes to questions like these, the experts are best at predicting what’s on the horizon. So, we’ve put together six expert opinions about what’s in store for some of today’s top technologies. From Python to PowerShell and Java to Scrum, here’s how you can expect the future to unfold. \nPYTHON \n“If Python isn’t everywhere, it will be soon. One of the biggest indicators I can find at the moment? Microsoft is considering adding Python support to its flagship Excel office product. Additionally, Python adoption is accelerating in key industries, due at least in part to the surge of interest in data science and machine learning —spaces where Python has become a staple technology. Looking at patterns of Stack Overflow queries across languages, the growth of Python is clearly being demonstrated.” \n- Python pro, Jim Christopher \nJAVA \n“With the release of Java 9, a host of enhancements have been added, including Optionals. And we are just now seeing the positive ripple effect Optionals are having on the API. Before Optionals, code could be quite brittle surrounding runtime exceptions and how to best handle errors. But as more developers embrace Optionals, I think we’ll start to see better APIs being developed. Other languages that run on the JVM, such as Kotlin and Scala, are already embracing this feature and it’s helping this adoption on new projects. In the past 18 months, there’s been a significant rise in the adoption of tools like Kotlin, and this is a direct reflection of how they have embraced this feature. \nWhile Optionals are a quick way to begin taking advantage of the enhancements Java 9 brings, there are also more complex features you should understand. The Stream enhancements in 8 and 9 are very complex features that tackle an even more intricate problem. If you haven’t taken the time to learn them, I recommend doing a sprint with these Stream enhancements just to understand the problems they fix and how you can apply them in the future.” \n- 20+ year Java developer, Bryan Hansen \nANGULAR \n“Angular continues to keep pace with important changes in modern web development, yet provides stability for developers, libraries and tools. It achieves both goals by implementing semantic versioning, a planned deprecation policy and clearly defined release cycles. That’s why developers can easily move from Angular 4 to 5 , for example, with little or no changes to their application. You can expect this goal of compatibility to continue, making it painless to migrate to future versions of Angular. If you want to build modern web applications, learning Angular is a step in the right direction. Begin with the basics to get a firm foundation and a conceptual overview of its features and capabilities. Then dive into more intermediate level topics to expand your knowledge and learn patterns for real-world development.” \n- Angular expert, Deborah Kurata \nPOWERSHELL \n“PowerShell is the future. Sure, small companies may not need a lot of automation, because that will increasingly be done for them through services like Office 365. Old, stodgy companies might simply refuse to go that way, but their IT overhead is going to become a competitive disadvantage soon. But, automation is a business reality, not just a convenience for IT people. It’s taking business leaders some time to understand and appreciate that, but now the momentum is there and they’re all going to start demanding it. \nI can imagine two reasons why someone might not learn PowerShell and other automation technologies. First, you may already have related skills, so you think you can ignore this one. Second, you could be afraid of change because the technology seems hard and you don’t want to risk failing. These reasons lead to a dead-end street for your career. PowerShell could be your key to a better job, a massively better salary and a better place in life.” \n- Powershell pro, Don Jones \nSCRUM FRAMEWORK \n“As adoption of the Scrum framework continues to surge, Scrum practitioners are encountering many interesting challenges. The biggest challenge they currently face is implementation of the Scrum framework at scale. Many organizations who initially began with small and lightweight Scrum pilot projects are now ready to capitalize on their success by promoting Scrum adoption to the rest of their organization. \nHowever, this doesn’t mean bigger and bigger Scrum teams, as you might expect. I nstead, adoptions of the Scrum framework are grown simply by increasing the number of small, cross-functional Scrum Teams, and then enabling them to work in concert in whatever way allows them to be most effective. As you can imagine, enabling dozens of teams to work collaboratively in an incremental and iterative manner yields many unique challenges, but the results can be dramatic. \nSo long as Scrum’s creators continue to evolve it to better meet the needs of today’s teams, it may remain the dominant methodology for agile teams and keep increasing the demand for qualified Scrum practitioners, especially Scrum Masters.” \n- Scrum expert, Jeremy Jarrell \nHTML5 \n“As one of the most fundamental building blocks of the web, HTML is a staple technology—meaning an understanding of it and how it will impact the future is key. \nShort term, the W3C plans to release a Recommendation in 2018, so we should see some new elements and improvements with 5.3. Following updates to the WHATWG Living Standard is a good way to get a pulse on what is being added and removed. Long term, HTML will need to evolve to meet the modern needs of web application developers and complex technologies like VR. So, paying attention now is crucial.” \n- Web developer, Susan Simkins \nUncover where your skills stand in these technologies. Use Pluralsight IQ to find out. Special Offer",

      "text": "NGT slams Karnataka for action plan on Bengaluru's Bellandur lake, calls report submitted by state 'incorrect' India PTI Apr 11, 2018 15:35:20 IST Tweet \nNew Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday slammed the Karnataka government over its action plan on Bengaluru's Bellandur lake and formed a committee to inspect the lakes in the city. A bench headed by NGT acting chairperson Justice Jawad Rahim said the report submitted by the state government was \"incorrect and misleading\" and was bereft of the actual action taken on the ground. \n\"This is not what we expected from the state authorities. The action plan submitted by the state contains incorrect and misleading information. The report submitted by the state does not convince us. There has been a default in compliance with the order of the tribunal. File image of Bellandur Lake. News18 \n\"We are not here just to read files and close them. Compliance with the order has to be done, Do you want us to call the army for compliance,\" the bench observed. The green panel, which stopped short of imposing a fine on the state and its instrumentalities, formed a committee comprising senior advocate Raj Panjwani, a professor from Indian Institute of Science- Bangalore, a senior scientist from Central Pollution Control Board, the commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the secretary of Bangalore Development Authority and a lawyer to be chosen by the senior advocate. \nThe committee would inspect Agara, Bellandur and Varthur lakes in Bangalore on 14 and 15 April. The committee has been directed to submit a detailed report after conducting an inspection of the lakes and inform the tribunal about the quantum of municipal solid waste generated by the apartments and other agencies in the vicinity of the water body. \n\"The committee shall inform the tribunal about the extent of hydrophytes in the lakes along with the incidents of fire which have taken place till 10 April, 2018, the condition of treatment plants around the lake, if any, and whether the apartments have obtained the occupancy certificates from authority,\" the bench said. Hydrophytes are aquatic plants that grow in or near water and provides cover for fish and other aquatic organisms. \nThe tribunal had earlier rapped the state for not removing weeds and macrophytes from Bengaluru's Bellandur lake at regular intervals despite specific orders and directed it to submit monthly compliance reports. \nThe tribunal had directed the state government to produce sufficient material proof of the action taken in this regard and posted the matter for hearing on 11 April. On 29 January, the green panel had directed Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru to carry out a pilot study on the visible aquatic plants. \n\"Considering the role of macrophytes in rendering the quality of water in lakes below acceptable levels, it is necessary that the macrophytes menace is terminated once and for all,\" the NGT had said. Earlier, the green panel had come down heavily on the Karnataka government for not taking active measures to prevent recurring incidents of fire at the severely polluted Bellandur lake. \nPublished Date: Apr 11, 2018 15:35 PM | Updated Date: Apr 11, 2018 15:35 PM",

She subsequently underwent a series of medical tests. \nHer urine samples were sent for analysis at a forensic laboratory here and after receiving its report, the hospital authorities said she had an overdose of anti-depressants that were not prescribed to her. \n“The reports of her urine sample showed a significant increase in the level of benzodiazepine, a class of anti-depressants,” a doctor from the hospital had said, quoting from reports of the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina. \nThe state prisons department earlier ordered an inquiry to find out how Mukerjea fell ill in the jail. The IG (prisons) will submit his report to the department after completing the inquiry. \nMukerjea, the co-founder of INX Media, is the prime accused in her daughter Sheena Bora’s murder case. \nBora (25) was allegedly killed and her body disposed of in a forest area in the neighbouring Raigad district in April 2012, according to the police. \nMukerjea, her former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai were arrested for the crime. Rai had later turned an approver (prosecution witness) in the case. For all the latest India News , download Indian Express App More Related News ",

      "text": "WhatsApp scouts for India head \nThe green panel, which stopped short of imposing a fine on the state and its instrumentalities, formed a committee comprising senior advocate Raj Panjwani, a professor from Indian Institute of Science- Bangalore, a senior scientist from Central Pollution Control Board, the commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, the secretary of Bangalore Development Authority and a lawyer to be chosen by the senior advocate. \nThe committee would inspect Agara, Bellandur and Varthur lakes lakes in Bangalore on April 14 and 15. \nThe committee has been directed to submit a detailed report after conducting inspection of the lakes and inform the tribunal about the quantum of municipal solid waste generated by the apartments and other agencies in the vicinity of the water body. \n\"The committee shall inform the tribunal about the extent of hydrophytes in the lakes along with the incidents of fire which have taken place till April 10, 2018, condition of treatment plants around the lake, if any, and whether the apartments have obtained the occupancy certificates from authority,\" the bench said. \nHydrophytes are aquatic plants that grow in or near water and provides cover for fish and other aquatic organisms. \nThe tribunal had earlier rapped the state for not removing weeds and macrophytes from Bengaluru's Bellandur lake at regular intervals despite specific orders and directed it to submit monthly compliance reports. \nThe tribunal had directed the state government to produce sufficient material proof of the action taken in this regard and posted the matter for hearing on April 11. \nOn January 29, the green panel had directed Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bengaluru to carry out a pilot study on the visible aquatic plants. \"Considering the role of macrophytes in rendering the quality of water in lakes below acceptable levels, it is necessary that the macrophytes menace is terminated once and for all,\" the NGT had said.",

Hospital and was taken back to the Byculla prison, a senior official said. \nMukerjea, who was admitted in the state-run J.J. Hospital for the treatment of suspected drug overdose has been brought back to the jail, Inspector General (prisons) Rajvardhan Sinha said. \nHer health condition is better, the hospital’s dean Dr. S.D. Nanandkar said. \nMukerjea, 46, was on April 6 admitted to the hospital, where she was brought in a “semi-conscious” condition from her cell in the Byculla Jail in south Mumbai. \nShe subsequently underwent a series of medical tests. \nHer urine samples were sent for analysis at a forensic laboratory here and after receiving its report, the hospital authorities said she had an overdose of anti-depressants that were not prescribed to her. \n“The reports of her urine sample showed a significant increase in the level of benzodiazepine, a class of anti-depressants,” a doctor from the hospital had said, quoting from reports of the Forensic Science Laboratory at Kalina. \nThe state prisons department earlier ordered an inquiry to find out how Mukerjea fell ill in the jail. The IG (prisons) will submit his report to the department after completing the inquiry. Mukerjea, the co-founder of INX Media, is the prime accused in her daughter Sheena Bora’s murder case. \nSheena Bora (25) was allegedly killed and her body disposed off in a forest area in the neighbouring Raigad district in April 2012, according to the police. \nMukerjea, her former husband Sanjeev Khanna and driver Shyamvar Rai were arrested for the crime. Rai had later turned an approver (prosecution witness) in the case.",

      "text": "SHARE \nSun signs have really distinct characteristics that give each of them certain quirks. If you look around at the people in your life, you might just notice these eccentricities and traits in them. For instance, each sun sign could well represent a family member. If that were to be the case, here is the relative or family member each sign would be! Aries: The spinster aunt who raises hell \nAries is angsty, fiery, and a total party animal. This is a sign that eggs on fights, loves their motorcycle jackets, and knows how to raise hell. Considering their fierce nature, they are the ones who will make you do wild things and encourage you to have more adventurous experiences! Taurus: The uncle who makes way too many wife jokes \nTaurus is that uncle who pretends to be deaf when his wife calls him to help in the kitchen. Taurus is also that uncle who forwards wife jokes on WhatsApp family groups. A baby deep inside, he won't invest any emotions in others, but expects others to deliver them to him on a silver platter. Gemini: Every busybody toddler nephew or niece \nGemini is represented by the toddler on the Karmic wheel of life. As people who are very hyper, easily-distracted, and playful, we'd say Gemini fits the bill. Cute and charming, they will tire you with their boundless mischief, but will still provide an entertaining time at family gatherings! Cancer: The mom \nEven people who don't know much about astrology are aware of Cancer's strong maternal instinct. This sign loves to cook and care for other people, blanketing everyone in a quilt of security. You want to leave the house without eating? That's not happening if Cancer gets her way! Leo: That middle-aged uncle who lectures everyone \nLeo will be very generous with you, but in return for making you their audience. Be prepared to sit and listen to them tell long stories filled with exaggerations. God forbid you mess up in any avenue of life, because they will take the opportunity to lecture you, especially on how you can be more like them! Virgo: The \"good girl\" sister whom your parents always compare you to \nVirgo is that sober, dutiful girl who studied science with maths, didn't have a boyfriend in school, never talks back to her parents, got married at the right age, and is super helpful around the house. She does everything right, everything that you don't. However, she is also someone you can count on to help you, so there is no way to even hate her! Libra: The pretty young cousin who married early and dresses really well \nLibra is that cousin who will shower you with pretty gifts like makeup and cute clothes. Ruled by the planet of beauty and love, she is the one family member who hasn't been single since she was 14, and wanted to marry everyone she dated. Now, she designs jewellery and is an influencer. Scorpio: The doctor uncle \nFascinated by complex things like science, not only do many Scorpios become doctors, but are also the people you'd normally talk to when in a fix, making them the healers of the group. Whether you have cheated on your spouse and got herpes, or need to blackmail someone, these people are the cool and clinical minds to consult. Sagittarius: Every religious aunt who spends weekends at the ashram \nYou failed your exam? She'll get her astrologer to give you the perfect gemstone for it. Your pet lizard died? It was probably because you didn't come to her ‘jagran' last weekend and donate to the priests. Spiritual, religious, and full of controversial opinions, Sagittarius is this aunt! Capricorn: The quintessential grandpa \n‘When I was your age' is often how Capricorns and grandpas begin their statements, no matter how old they are. A human mix of scotch and tobacco, this sign is known to be the \"old man\" of the zodiac, tired of careless young people and their silly shenanigans, and fixated on the tradition of the bygone days. Aquarius: The nerdy genius brother who is too smart for everyone else \nAquarius was famously described by iconic astrologer Linda Goodman as \"too smart for his old blue jeans.\" If you have ever met an Aquarian, you will know this to be true. Disdainful about the inferior intellect of everyone else in their family, they are the Alex Dunphies of the world. Pisces: The unemployed distant cousin who wants to be a musician \nYou might miss Pisces at most family gatherings, because they're sitting outside in the backyard smoking pot and playing guitar, trying to pen yet another song about dismantling capitalism. This sign is all about being \"chill,\" so much so that a 9 to 5 job and family life feels too forced and conformist to them. 144 Shares",

      "text": "» Indrani Mukerjea discharged from Mumbai's JJ Hospital Indrani Mukerjea discharged from Mumbai's JJ Hospital India   16:14   \nIndrani Mukerjea, who was arrested for allegedly killing her daughter Sheena Bora, was discharged from Mumbai's JJ Hospital. Indrani was on Friday admitted to the state-run hospital where she was brought in a semi-conscious condition from her prison cell at the Byculla Jail in south Mumbai.
