      "text": "  \nMumbai, Apr 11 (PTI) Rising for the fifth straight session, NSE Nifty gained 14.90 points to close at 10,417.15 today, led by gains in metal, IT, auto, pharma and media counters amid mixed Asian cues.Sustained buying by domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and a mixed trend at Asian bourses following overnight gains at the Wall Street helped key indices close in the positive zone. However, a steep rise in crude oil prices remained an overhang on investor sentiment.Investors are now focusing on key macroeconomic data, including retail inflation and industrial production numbers due on Thursday and corporate results starting Friday, brokers said.Overseas, European equities were trading lower, tracking mixed cues from Asian market, with traders failing to take any significant succour from new signs that trade tension between the US and China was easing.Back home, the NSE 50-share index, after moving between 10,428.15 and 10,355.60 on alternate bouts of selling and buying, finally closed at 10,417.15, up 14.90 points, or 0.14 percent. The Nifty witnessed an intra-day movement of about 72.55 points.Sector-wise, Metal rose by 1.59 per cent, followed by IT 1.45 per cent, Auto 0.59 per cent, Pharma 0.48 percent, Media 0.29 per cent and FMCG 0.21 per cent.On the other hand, PSU Bank fell by 2.33 per cent, Bank 0.51 per cent, Energy 0.40 per cent, Realty 0.39 per cent, Finance Service 0.36 per cent and Private Bank 0.33 per cent. Major index gainers were Vedanta, TCS, Sun Pharma, HCL Tech, Eicher Motors, Titan, Hindalco, Reliance and Tech Mahindra.The losers were BPCL, HPCL, IOC, Adani Ports, SBI, Yes Bank, GAIL, Grasim, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank.The market breadth, indicating its overall health, was in favour of losers. On the NSE, 728 stocks advanced, 1,055 declined and 86 remained unchanged.Turnover in the cash segment rose to Rs 29,878.82 crore from Rs 27,871.31 crore as on Tuesday.A total of 14,414.47 lakh shares changed hands in 96,00,122 trades.

The new financing will help modernize state-owned banks, expand regional telecommunication connectivity, electronic-government services and create enabling environment for private sector investment, Xinhua news agency reported. Improving the quality of health services, strengthening the banking infrastructure and digitising government systems will enhance our ability to deliver better and quality services to our people, said Finance Minister Eklil Hakimi. This contribution demonstrates the continued commitment and support of international community helping the government of Afghanistan implement priority reforms for sustainable development, he said. Afghanistan is implementing an ambitious reform programme in a context of strong budget pressures imposed by low domestic revenue, massive security spending and enormous development needs, said Shubham Chaudhuri, World Bank country Director for Afghanistan. In this challenging environment, we remain committed to helping the government of Afghanistan in further improving the service delivery to the Afghan people, he said. --IANS",

      "text": "April 11, 2018 23:24   23:24 IST more-in Telangana RBI assures enough cash supply for Rythu Bandhu scheme \nThe Telangana government has allayed fears that the present cash crunch in banks may adversely impact the Crop Investment Support Scheme after the Finance Department got a categorical assurance from the Reserve Bank of India officials that ₹6,000 crore cash required for the scheme will be released to the banks soon. \nSources told The Hindu on Wednesday that the government issued the Budget Release Order for ₹ 6,000 crore to the Agriculture Department on Tuesday, of which ₹ 2,000 crore was released to the department on Wednesday. The department in turn will release the amount to various banks to allow the farmers encash their bearer cheques under the Crop Investment Support scheme as and when they require it. The government decided to give ₹ 4,000 per acre to the farmers under the scheme for Kharif and and an equal amount for Rabi season. The scheme would cost the government about ₹ 12,000 crore in a year. \nFirst tranche \nThe government will release another ₹ 2,000 crore to the Agriculture Department by month-end. “The government is fully geared to distribute the cheques to the farmers. The first tranche of 16 lakh cheques has been received in Hyderabad and being checked by officials. The cheques will be despatched to the mandals in a couple of days. We are ready with logistics and infrastructure to roll out the scheme to help the farmers buy inputs required for their crops in time,” sources said. \nThe State earns about ₹10,000 crore revenue a month and it is not difficult for it to allocate the required amount to the agriculture department for the crop investment support scheme. The Finance Department can also raise market loans to augment the funds, sources said. \nHighly placed sources also confirmed that the RBI has agreed to the State’s request to increase the money supply to the State. It would release ₹ 6,000 crore to the banks over a period of one month to one-and-a half month. \nThe distribution of cheques to farmers is expected to start in the third week of April though no date has been announced so far. The date will be announced soon by the Chief Minister, sources added. \nIncentives to banks \nMeanwhile, the government is considering to request the banks to give priority in releasing cash to farmers who present the bearer cheques under the crop investment support scheme. There will be incentives to those banks which facilitate farmers to encash their cheques, they said. \nCommenting on the cash crunch in the banks, government sources said that it was apparent that people who had withdrawn money were not depositing the cash back for various reasons. But government could not force people to deposit the cash into the banks. \n“For some reason, either due to unknown fears, recent scams in public sector and private banks, people are opting to keep cash with them rather than in the banks for the fear that they may not be able to withdraw cash when they need it,” they explained.",

      "text": "The finance ministry reportedly wants to convert the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN), a private company that manages the indirect tax infrastructure, into a government company to ostensibly protect sensitive data.\nThis is a bad idea. A change in ownership structure does not reduce the vulnerability of the network to cyberattacks. Data showed that 114 government websites were hacked during April 2017 to January 2018.\nRecently, a French security researcher shared how he hacked BSNL’s website, and got hold of details of its employees, and the state-owned telco acknowledged this. Last week, the defence ministry and many other government websites faced downtime, though the government rejected cyberattacks.\nIt is technology, systems and safety protocols that will protect critical networks against cyberattacks, not state ownership.\nGSTN was set up as a private company: non-government financial institutions hold 51% equity and the balance 49% is with the government. The idea was to give the company operational freedom to run the network — in which tax receipts and input tax credit claims are uploaded and processed to reconcile claims and spot tax liability — efficiently.\nThe system needs constant upgradation and maintenance. It makes sense to let the GSTN operate as a private company that is capable of buying services and hardware fast so that the critical system is not held hostage to time-consuming rules of government procurement that mandate purchases at the lowest-Quote: d price, or L1.\nThe government exercises strategic control, but the company is free from public sector speed breakers such as audit by the CAG, and complaints to the Vigilance Commission. It is also free to hire professionals laterally and pay market-linked salaries. Keep it as it is.",

      "text": "Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, Founder & Mentor, Bandhan Konnagar Kolkata April 11 \nBandhan-Konnagar, a non-profit organisation of the Bandhan group, is looking to provide financial support to close to 3 lakh underprivileged families under its ‘Targeting Hardcore Poor’ (THP) programme in the next five years. \nAccording to Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, founder and mentor, Bandhan Konnagar, the NGO is set to receive World Bank funding support for the same. As many as 70,000 families have benefited from the THP programme so far. \nExpansion plans \n“The World Bank wants us to scale up the programme in Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. We hope to be able to bring close to 3 lakh underprivileged families under this programme in the next five years,” Ghosh told newspersons on the sidelines of the Development Day celebration of Bandhan Konnagar here on Wednesday. \nThe THP programme has been implemented in Assam, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, Telengana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tripura. The State governments of Rajasthan and Jharkhand have already tied up with Bandhan-Konnagar, providing them financial support for the implementation of the programme in certain districts. \nFunding support \nThe NGO spends ₹25,000-30,000 per family on an average during the 24-month programme. Apart from World Bank funding support, Bandhan Bank has earmarked close to 2 per cent of its CSR spend on the programme. It also receives funding support from corporates such as ITC, HDFC and Indigo. \nUnder the THP programme, the NGO identifies hardcore poor families who have not had access to traditional finance initiatives and provides them with a productive livelihood asset such as poultry, handicrafts, sewing machine or helps them set up a shop, thereby creating opportunity for sustainable living.

      "text": "Methane gas plant (file photo) - By Special Arrangement New Delhi, April 11 \nCoal India and its subsidiaries will now be able to extract Coal Bed Methane from its mines without seeking approvals under the Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules 1959 (PNG Rules, 1959). \nAn official statement said that the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs has approved amending clause 3 (xiii) of the notification dated 03.11.2015 issued by the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural gas under Section 12 of the Oil Fields (Regulation and Development) Act, 1948 (ORD Act, 1948). \n“Due to this amendment relaxation is granted under the Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules 1959 (PNG Rules, 1959), to Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries for not applying for grant of license/lease under the PNG Rules, 1959 for extraction of Coal Bed Methane (CBM) under their Coal Bearing Areas,” the statement added. \nThe government expects that this will expedite the exploration and exploitation of CBM, enhance the availability of natural gas and reduce the gap in demand and supply of natural gas. \nThe government had earlier issued a notification on 03.11.2015 granted rights to CIL and its subsidiaries for exploration and exploitation of CBM from all coal bearing areas for which they possess mining lease for coal. \nIn another decision, the Cabinet approved the delegation of powers to the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Finance to approve the award of the Blocks/Contract Areas to successful bidders under HELP/OALP after International Competitive Bidding (ICB).

      "text": "CMP: ₹1,566.60 \nTarget: ₹1,925 \nOver the past few years, while commercial vehicle volumes have been stagnant, there has been a marked shift in mix towards higher-tonnage vehicles. In addition, price hikes in the past two years have been healthy (18-20 per cent on new vehicles). \nWhile the addressable market size for Shriram Transport Finance in terms of volumes will remain largely stable, we believe better pricing and mix will drive disbursement and Assets Under Management growth. AUM is likely to grow 18-19 per cent in FY18 as compared to the management’s earlier guidance of 15 per cent growth. \nAfter seven years of unchanged profits (₹1,200-1,300 crore), we expect the company to report ₹1,800 crore PAT in FY18, and subsequently, ₹2,500 crore and ₹3,100 crore in FY19 and FY20 respectively. \nAt two times the FY-20E book value, we believe the stock is attractively priced.

      "text": "Our Bureau T+ T- Harsh Kumar Bhanwala, Chairman, Nabard - THE HINDU Aims to increase its long-term refinancing; to launch ‘Water Atlas’ to map water consumption patterns of crops Mumbai, April 11 \n\nIn a bid to support investment credit in the farm sector and infrastructure build-up in rural areas, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) is planning to raise about ₹40,000 crore through bond issuance in FY2019. \nIn FY2018, Nabard raised ₹33,000 crore against ₹25,000 crore in FY2017. The weighted average borrowing cost came down to 7.05 per cent against 7.35 per cent. \n“We are rated ‘AAA’ (by credit rating agencies). We are a zero (net) non-performing asset institution and our capital adequacy is strong at 18 per cent,” said Harsh Kumar Bhanwala, Chairman, at a press meet to announce Nabard’s financial performance. \nFocus areas \nAccording to Bhanwala, Nabard’s focus, among others, is to boost long-term refinance (to regional rural banks, co-operative banks and commercial banks) so that asset creation happens in the agriculture sector and farm productivity improves; to provide States’ support for establishing rural infrastructure – roads, irrigation, veterinary hospitals, primary schools and primary health centres; and also to give funding support for setting up warehouses, modernisation of dairies and rural housing. \nIn FY2018, the development financial institution, which is focussed on providing institutional credit to boost the rural economy, reported a 12 per cent increase in surplus at ₹2,950 crore against ₹2,631 crore in the year-ago period. \nBalance sheet size \nNabard’s balance sheet size increased by 17 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) to ₹4,06,473 crore in FY2018. \nLoans and advances, including long-term finance, loans under Rural Infrastructure Development Fund, Food Processing Fund, Warehousing Infrastructure Fund, Prime Minister’s Gramin Awas Yojana, and other direct loans, rose 15 per cent y-o-y at ₹3,54,688 crore. \nWater Atlas \nMeanwhile, Nabard, in association with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, is planning to launch a ‘Water Atlas’ to map the water consumption patterns of 10 crops across different States. \nBhanwala said water consumption per kilogram of crop output will be mapped so that crop planning and water efficiency can happen across the country.

      "text": "April 11, 2018 21:45 IST Updated: April 11, 2018 21:45 IST more-in Cabinet move will expedite decision-making process relating to HELP \nThe Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a proposal to delegate the power to award hydrocarbon blocks to successful bidders under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) to Petroleum and Finance Ministers. \n“In line with the government initiative of ease of doing business, the Union Cabinet has given its approval for delegating the powers to Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Finance Minister to award the blocks/contract areas to successful bidders under Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) after International Competitive Bidding (ICB) based on the recommendations of Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECS),” the government said in a statement. \nUnder HELP, blocks are to be awarded twice in a year. Delegating powers would expedite the decision-making process in awarding the blocks, according to the statement. “Under the New Exploration Licensing Policy [which was in place before HELP was implemented in 2016], ECS considers the bid evaluation criteria (BEC), conducts negotiations with the bidders wherever necessary, and makes recommendations to CCEA on award of blocks,” the statement said. “The CCEA approves the award of blocks. The entire process, including Inter Ministerial Consultations (IMC), is quite lengthy and time consuming.” \nIn a separate decision, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved the issuance of a notification that would allow Coal India Limited (CIL) and its subsidiaries to extract coal bed methane (CBM) in their coal bearing areas without applying for a licence or lease under the Petroleum & Natural Gas Rules, 1959. \nExploration of CBM \n“The decision will expedite the exploration and exploitation of CBM, enhance the availability of natural gas and reduce the gap in demand and supply of natural gas,” the government said in a separate statement. \n“The increased development activities for exploration and exploitation of CBM gas reserves in and around the block will generate economic activities which, in turn, has potential to create employment opportunities in CBM operations and in the industries,” it said.",

      "text": "Delayed payments troubling flagship rural employment guarantee scheme, allege civil society groups Joe C Mathew   00:00 IST \nThe central government is failing to ensure timely payments for the work carried out by labourers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MN-NREGA) scheme in the past few months, complains a civil society group. \nThe NREGA Sangharsh Morcha, a group comprising of workers' collectives, trade unions, organisations and individuals that closely track India's flagship employment guarantee scheme, says that 99 per cent of the Fund Transfer Orders (FTOs) for NREGA wage payments sent to the Public Finance Management (PFMS) in April 2018 remains unprocessed. For the month of March, the percentage of unprocessed payments or FTOs stands at 86. Almost 64 per cent of the FTOs of February also remain unprocessed, they complain. \nIt was in January 2016 that the central government introduced the National Electronic Fund Management System (NEFMS) to streamline the process of NREGA wage payments. Civil society groups allege that the system had only tightened the ministry's control over NREGA funds as it 'routinely withholds the processing of FTOs'. \n\"Last year, the Ministry froze processing of FTOs worth over Rs 3,000 crores due to lack of NREGA funds. It may be recalled that in August 2017, the Ministry of Rural Development demanded a supplementary NREGA budget of Rs 17,000 crore, but the Ministry of Finance approved only Rs 7,000 crore, that too in January 2018. As inadequate funds should not be a problem at the beginning of a financial year, the reason for the current non-processing of FTOs is not clear\", Jean Dreze, a development economist and activist says. \nIn an interim directive in ongoing public interest litigation by Swaraj Abhiyan, the Supreme Court had instructed the government to ensure that workers are paid within 15 days of doing work. The activists say that the situation of long and unpredictable delays in NREGA wage payments continues despite the Supreme Court directive. Incidentally, there is a clause which entitles the workers for compensation if the payments are delayed beyond a fixed time. \nLast year, the activists had produced documents to show that the finance ministry had itself accepted the problem of partial payment of compensation, but stated that the full payment for the entire duration of delay will be a heavy financial burden on the government. \"As the Modi government failed to curtail NREGA through overt measures such as restricting the programme to the poorest districts or reducing the wage - material ratio, it has resorted to undermining the Act by starving it of funds\", the Morcha states.",

      "text": "Capt Abhimanyu Haryana collects stamp duty revenue of over Rs 4,265 crore Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Capt Abhimanyu said that this increase in the revenue is in spite of the slowdown in transactions of immovable property. PTI | April 11, 2018, 18:30 IST Newsletter A A CHANDIGARH: Haryana government has collected revenue of over Rs 4,265.18 crore as stamp duty and registration fee during the period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 as against Rs 3,260 crore in 2016-17, registering an increase of over Rs 1,005 crore. Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Capt Abhimanyu said that this increase in the revenue is in spite of the slowdown in transactions of immovable property. Abhimanyu said here today that there has been a record increase in the revenue from stamp duty and registration fee so far in the state. \"This has been achieved, despite market stagnation as there has not been commensurate increase in the total number of deeds. The stamp collection in the year 2017-18 is the highest so far in the history of Revenue department,\" he added. He said that this increase in revenue collection could be possible due to regular monitoring and key reforms in land records management and deed registration. \"During the last one year, state has carried out a number of reforms with an aim to bring hundred per cent transparency in deed registration, zero tolerance and hassle free services to the citizens,\" the minister said. Abhimanyu, who also hold the Finance portfolio, said that new registration system has been implemented in all tehsils and sub-tehsils of the state through E-disha from February 3, 2015, which has resulted not only in saving the time of applicants but also helped in keeping a tab on corruption. He said that under this system, the applicant could get the registry through post within three days. He said the e-stamping system has been implemented in the state with effect from May 2, 2015, which has helped in increasing the revenue and also put a check on corruption. RELATED ",

      "text": "New Delhi, Apr 11 (PTI) There are no free lunches under the GST, literally, with the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) saying that recovery of food expenses from employees for canteen services would attract the new indirect tax.\nThe Kerala bench of the AAR in its order said that recovery of food expenses from the employees for canteen services provided by a company are taxable as a supply of service under the Goods and Services Tax (GST).\nThe ruling was given by the AAR on an application filed by Malappuram-based Caltech Polymers. The company approached the AAR to seek advance ruling on whether recovery of food expenses from employees for canteen services would come under definition of outward supplies and attract the GST.\n\"... recovery of food expenses from the employees for the canteen services provided by company would come under the definition of outward supply as defined in Section 2(83) of the Act, 2017, and therefore, taxable as a supply of service under GST,\" said the AAR order.\nUnder the Factories Act, 1948, any factory employing more than 250 workers is required to provide canteen facility to its employees.\nLevying of GST on canteen services provided by employers to employees would increase the compliance burden of companies, PwC Partner and Leader Indirect Tax Pratik Jain said.\n\"The revenue collections for the Government in such cases is not likely to be substantial, given that input credit might be available to businesses in many cases. However, the compliance burden on industry would be significant, along with possible disputes on valuation,\" he said.\nThe government, Jain said, should either provide some guidance on such aspects or consider providing an exemption from GST on such recoveries.\nHe further said that it was not clear whether GST would be levied at 5 per cent (without input credit) as canteen shall apply on all such recoveries from employees or a residual rate of 18 per cent will be applicable, treating it as outdoor catering services.\nLast week, the finance ministry had clarified that a 5 per cent GST will be levied on food and drinks supplied by the Indian Railways or IRCTC in trains, platforms or stations.\nThis was done to bring uniformity in the rate of GST applicable to supply of food and drinks made available in trains, platforms or stations.\nAMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said this verdict would push up the cost of food for factory workers.\n\"Also if such decisions are pursued from July 2017, we could see considerable tax demands in corporate sector with matching interest and penalties,\" Mohan said.

Air India privatisation: Big bonanza coming for employees; top 5 updates Centre may ease expression of interest deadline for 76% stake in Air India After IndiGo, Jet Airways not to participate in bid for stake in Air India \nA potential buyer of Air India will take over interest bearing debt of around Rs 165 billion. A large portion of the debt is backed by assets like aircraft that Air India owns. Interest-bearing debt is the portion of the debt over which banks charge interest. \nAccording to the preliminary information memorandum shared by the government, Rs 333.92 billion of debt will remain in the company’s books while the rest will be hived off into a separate asset holding company. It includes current liabilities, which have been incurred over natural course of business. \nAccording to people privy to the transaction process, out of Rs 333.92 billion, Rs 88.16 billion is on account of current liabilities. Essentially, these are bills that are due to creditors and suppliers within a short period of time like one year. “In any merger and acquisitions, current liabilities are passed onto the buyer,” the person said. \nOut of the remaining Rs 245 billion, around Rs 80 billion is on account of finance lease of aircraft. Finance leasing is one of the lucrative forms of aircraft financing under which lessor receives substantially all rights of ownership. Aircraft taken under finance lease is considered to be an asset of the company in contrast to an operating lease which impacts the company’s cash flow.“Finance lease can be terminated to get out of the liability and thus the actual debt over which a buyer has to pay interest comes down to around Rs 165 billion. This is a fairly clean slate for an airline of Air India’s size and potentials,” the person said. He said that many global airline majors like Lufthansa, Etihad and British Airways have shown interest. Queries have also come from marquee private equity funds like US-based Warburg Pincus, Singapore-based GIC and Temasek. \nAdditionally, a large portion of the debt are aircraft related debt, meaning they are backed by aircraft value. According to research by brokerage firm ICICI Securities, more than 50 percent of the debt will be backed by aircraft value. Air India owns 32 aircraft, and has 37 aircraft on finance lease while Air India Express owns 17 aircraft on finance lease as on FY17. Giving a breakdown of the calculations, the research report said that aircraft related debt of Air India and Air India Express is around Rs 160 billion and Rs 11 billion respectively.\nAnalysts have supported the claims saying that the terms and conditions are aligned to generating interest from investors. “ EOI has attempted to balance the needs of different stakeholders while moving the process forward. As it happens in such complex transactions, being flexible and having an open mind on major issues is necessary. Revising EOI with more liberal terms will be required to further align it to investor interest,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO of aviation consultancy firm CAPA. \nAir India’s debt has been a major bone of contention for potential suitors as two private airlines- IndiGo and Jet Airways have expressed unwillingness to participate in bidding process at current terms and conditions. “It is the question based on the evaluation that we did and felt that this level of debt on the asset may not be appropriate for us. It may be appropriate for someone else,” said Amit Agarwal, deputy CEO, Jet Airways. First Published: Wed, April 11 2018. 19:53 IST",

      "text": "‘Ayushman Bharat will promote wellness centres for preventive, curative care’ But the implementation of the Centre’s ambitious scheme may be more challenging than GST or Aadhaar \nA nation’s development and growth is gauged by the health of its population. The fact that even after 70 years of independence, 80 per cent of the Indian population is not covered under any health insurance scheme and the average cost of in-patient treatment is almost half of their annual household expenditure is bound to mar its growth story. \nHence, announcement of the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS) under the Ayushman Bharat Programme, in the Union Budget 2018-19, is timely and can be a trigger to achieving the country’s growth aspirations. \nThe government intended to achieve ‘Universal Health Cover’ at one go, but covering 1.3 billion population with the existing healthcare infrastructure and human resource is an impossible task. This prompted the government to settle at covering 40 per cent of the population — 50 crore people in the first phase. Described as “the world’s largest government-funded healthcare programme”, the sheer scale of this programme magnifies many its systemic challenges. \nIn terms of economic commitment, healthcare spends as a percentage of GDP across most nations that have achieved more than 80 per cent coverage of population is 5-12 per cent. For countries with large population, it takes 5-10 years to achieve 100 per cent coverage. \nA FICCI-EY study in 2012 estimated that to implement UHC in India by 2022, the government would need to allocate health expenditure between 3.7-4.5 per cent of the GDP, as against 1.4 per cent in 2017-18. The bed-to-population ratio needs to be raised to 1.7 beds per 1,000 population from the current 0.9 beds. The required number of beds can be lowered with focus on primary care, as studies indicate that a one per cent increase in primary care usage can reduce hospitalisation rate by 0.03 per cent. The country needs another 9 lakh graduate doctors for primary care and around 1.2 lakh specialist doctors for secondary and tertiary care services. \nThe hospital business, particularly the multi-speciality tertiary care business, is capital-intensive with a long gestation period. Several of the current operating assets in India are not delivering the expected returns. More financing options along with incentives and tax benefits need to be provided to the private sector to aid development of healthcare infrastructure in Tier II and Tier III cities. \nAyushman Bharat is an extremely ambitious and complex programme and could be as challenging if not more than the implementation of GST or Aadhaar. Since health is a State subject and States are expected to contribute 40 per cent funding for the scheme, it will be critical to streamline and harmonise the existing State health insurance schemes and RSBY to NHPS. \nThe choice of purchasing model and empanelling providers would be critical to the success of NHPS. Countries with both public and private health infrastructure, such as France, Germany, China and Indonesia, have opted for dual mechanism — “provision by government and contract in from private providers”. \nTrust deficit \nIndia also follows a dual mechanism, however, there is immense confusion, dissatisfaction and trust deficit amongst all stakeholders as the healthcare scenario in the country is still evolving and is rife with lack of standard practices. There is a pressing need to evaluate and re-consider existing public health insurance schemes where private healthcare providers have been facing huge challenges, particularly due to improper procedure for empanelment and costing and inordinate delay in reimbursement to hospitals. \nWhile a basic criterion exists for the empanelment of providers, mechanisms are yet to be developed to enable standardisation of service quality across provider categories. Although NABH accreditation ensures quality, only a small number of the hospitals are accredited. Considering the massive coverage of NHPS, the payers will have to widen their network of hospitals. Therefore, categorisation of hospitals into Entry level, Progressive level and Accreditation level — as specified by NABH — is necessary to overcome issues related to diversity of providers. In 2016, IRDAI notified ‘Entry Level’ as the minimum empanelment criteria for healthcare facilities by the insurance companies. \nReimbursement slabs should be objective, transparent and linked to accreditation according to the hospital categories. National Costing Guidelines and a standard costing template should be used for calculating reimbursement packages. \nTo improve clinical and operational efficiencies in the supply side, standardisation in clinical practice and other processes needs to be implemented through: \n• Adoption of standard treatment guidelines, electronic health record standards, clinical audits etc. across public and private hospitals, \n• Framing of referral protocols and implementing effective mechanisms for supervision leveraging technology. The Accountable Care Organization (ACO) model used in the US and other developed countries could be piloted in India to test the effectiveness for maintaining the continuum of care and, \n• Integration of technology at each level of the healthcare continuum such as tele-medicine for remote locations, health call-centres, tele-radiology, app based emergency response etc. \nWorkforce woes \nThe limited health workforce available to deliver the promised services under Ayushman Bharat with its required outreach and effectiveness is a major concern. In addition to strengthening the number of healthcare professionals, we need focused skilling, re-skilling and up-skilling programmes for existing as well as additional workforce. Three key steps in this direction would be: \n• Providing technical as well as soft skill training to Ayushman Mitras, with adequate incentives and provisions for periodic re-training and upgradation of skills, \n• Making General Practitioners (GPs) responsible for overseeing the primary health network and and incentivising them to prevent the number of hospitalisations \n• Introducing a nurse practitioner system in strict compliance with established clinical protocols, where they are authorised to handle several clinical responsibilities. \nSuccessful medical claims management and processing is one of the most tedious tasks under any insurance programme. The key problems arisefrom lack of training among insurance agents, missing or inaccurate documentation and time consumed in resolving claim denials. NHPS must use biometric enrolment process, mobile and app based technologies for claim processes and payment wallets for real-time payments to streamline claim management. A robust fraud and abuse control mechanism should be implemented through use of digital technologies, business intelligence frameworks and standards for de-empanelment. \nA Grievance Redressal Forum should be created to ensure timely resolution of complaints without intervention of civil or consumer courts. The government must encourage and recognise transparency, self-regulation and third party ratings and reward clinical outcomes to help bridge the widening trustdeficit in the sector. \nThe writer is Immediate Past President FICCI and Chairman Zydus Cadila- Cadila Healthcare Ltd Published on",

It also under-reported provisions towards such bad loans to the tune of Rs 2,061 crore. \nLast month, the central bank levied a penalty of Rs 58.9 crore on ICICI Bank , the country’s largest private sector lender, for failing to adhere to its directives regarding the sale of securities from the held-to-maturity, or HTM, portfolio. related news \nRBI had also earlier charged Indian Overseas Bank , Axis Bank , Yes Bank , IDFC Bank , IndusInd Bank and RBL bank for violation of the asset qualification and KYC norms laid down by the regulator. \nIn April last year, the RBI told banks to disclose bad loan divergence in their financial statements if it exceeded 15 percent. \nThe government-owned bank is already under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) among 10 other banks, imposed by the RBI in May last year for breaching NPA levels and negative return on assets (ROA). \nAt the end of December 2017, IDBI Bank reported its gross NPAs at Rs 50,622 crore, 24.72 percent or almost a quarter of its total loans. Its net loss for the October to December period stood at Rs 1,542 crore. \nThe central bank said, \"This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI...taking into account failure of the bank to adhere to the aforesaid directions issued by RBI.\" \nRBI is also said to have written a letter to the Finance Ministry expressing concerns over its poor financial health and that it may have under reported its NPAs in the previous financial year. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers, RBI has said.",

      "text": "Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in his Budget 2018 , re-introduced the Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) Tax, which was scrapped in 2004-05 by then Finance Minister P Chidambaram.\nThe LTCG tax essentially means levying a tax on profit generated from assets such as shares, real estate and share-oriented products held for a minimum period of one year from the date of acquisition. The tax regime will be applicable from April 1, 2018.\nThe investors will have to pay 10% tax on profit exceeding Rs 1 lakh made by selling any asset including shares, mutual funds and other shares-oriented schemes. It is noteworthy that there would be no tax deduction on gains accrued upto January 31, 2018.\nLTCG tax will be computed by deducting the cost of acquisition from the full value of consideration on transfer of the long-term capital asset.\nrelated news 4 reasons that indicate it’s time to exit a mutual fund First things first, calculate your taxable income 3 types of mutual funds for short-term, long-term requirements Meanwhile, the definition of LTCG is different for several products. To clear further confusion, the tax department came out with four scenarios:\nScenario 1: An equity share is acquired on 1st of January, 2017 at Rs. 100, its fair market value is Rs. 200 on 31st of January, 2018 and it is sold on 1st of April, 2018 at Rs. 250. As the actual cost of acquisition is less than the fair market value as on 31st of January, 2018, the fair market value of Rs. 200 will be taken as the cost of acquisition and the long-term capital gain will be Rs. 50 (Rs. 250 – Rs. 200).\nScenario 2: An equity share is acquired on 1st of January, 2017 at Rs. 100, its fair market value is Rs. 200 on 31st of January, 2018 and it is sold on 1st of April, 2018 at Rs. 150. In this case, the actual cost of acquisition is less than the fair market value as on 31st of January, 2018. However, the sale value is also less than the fair market value as on 31st of January, 2018. Accordingly, the sale value of Rs. 150 will be taken as the cost of acquisition and the long-term capital gain will be NIL (Rs. 150 – Rs. 150).\nScenario 3: An equity share is acquired on 1st of January, 2017 at Rs. 100, its fair market value is Rs. 50 on 31st of January, 2018 and it is sold on 1st of April, 2018 at Rs. 150. In this case, the fair market value as on 31st of January, 2018 is less than the actual cost of acquisition, and therefore, the actual cost of Rs. 100 will be taken as actual cost of acquisition and the long-term capital gain will be Rs. 50 (Rs. 150 – Rs. 100).\nScenario 4: An equity share is acquired on 1st of January, 2017 at Rs. 100, its fair market value is Rs. 200 on 31st of January, 2018 and it is sold on 1st of April, 2018 at Rs. 50. In this case, the actual cost of acquisition is less than the fair market value as on 31st January, 2018. The sale value is less than the fair market value as on 31st of January, 2018 and also the actual cost of acquisition. Therefore, the actual cost of Rs. 100 will be taken as the cost of acquisition in this case. Hence, the long-term capital loss will be Rs. 50 (Rs. 50 – Rs. 100) in this case.",

      "text": "Government's film body needs to re-invent itself Ajita Shashidhar   20:00 IST \nWill the Information & Broadcasting Ministry's plan to shut down the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) and the Children's Film Society of India (CFSI) and create a large umbrella organization help the cause of the Indian film industry? It does sound like a visionary idea, but the new organization in order to really make an impact on the industry has to be far more involved and proactive. India is the largest film producing country in the world but the Government's support to the industry is miniscule. Yes, NFDC is known to be shelling out over Rs 3,000 crore per year to fund films, but do those films ever see the light of the day? Unlikely. The CFSI also funds children films on a regular basis, but these films rarely get exhibition space. Children films screened in India are largely animated films released by international studios such as Disney. \nIn most evolved markets, especially in countries such as France, Germany and UK, the Government supports the industry in a huge way. \"In France, a considerable percentage of the tax that the Government collects from the film actually goes back to support the industry. They give funds to independent film makers not just to produce their films but also distribute them. They even have caps on how much one can spend on promotions and advertising so that there is fair play. In India we don't have any exhibition space for independent cinema. Multiplexes are not bothered about independent cinema,\" points out independent film-maker, Onir. Why can't the Government film body invest in the growth of the business of films and contribute to the GDP, questions Vikram Malhotra, Founder, Abundantia Entertainment. He says that the Government body should be ideally partnering with the private studios and co-producing films, financing them as well as set up talent infrastructure in addition to just funding independent art films. \"If the investments they are making are channelized properly, the Government could be the largest contributor to the Indian film eco-system. Why can't they partner with say Salman Khan to produce a children's film,\" remarks Malhotra. \nAll that the NFDC actively promotes today is the Film Bazaar which attracts buyers and researchers from across the world to come and buy Indian films. But why can't the Government body distribute and exhibit films too? The Government body also needs to be far more accountable. \"If it's spending Rs 50 crore on a film, it should also have an answer as to how the film is doing in the box office and more importantly, is it being screened in the first place,\" says Malhotra. \nSo, while an umbrella film organization certainly seems to be in the right direction, the body, first and foremost needs to be transparent. It should be a secretariat of motion pictures and promote public-private partnerships. Just funding a few films or at the most getting Indian films to be screened at film festivals abroad isn't enough. The Government-owned film body needs to learn several lessons of public-private partnerships from other markets to really be able to make an impact on the film industry.",

      "text": "April 11, 2018 19:57 IST Updated: April 11, 2018 19:57 IST more-in The project will be over a 22-kilometre stretch from the source of the river till Vazhayila bridge \nKilliyar Oruma, a mass clean-up drive in the Killi river along a stretch extending up to 22 km, will be held on April 14 from 8 a.m. onwards. \nAround 10,000 people, including workers of the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Scheme and the Ayyankali Employment Guarantee Scheme, people’s representatives, students, residents’ association members, and cultural figures will take part in the clean-up programme, aimed at clearing up the obstacles to the river’s flow. \nAnnouncing the event here on Wednesday at a press conference, D.K. Murali, MLA, and chairman of the Killiyar Mission Samiti, said the entire populace living on both sides of the river would take part in the various activities to rejuvenate the Killi river and prepare it for the upcoming monsoon. \nThe programme is part of the larger Killiyar Mission, which the Haritha Kerala Mission is carrying out with the local bodies in the area. The Nedumangad block panchayat and Nedumnagad municipality, along with Panavoor, Anad, Aruvikkara and Karakulam grama panchayats, are also part of the mission to revive the river. \nThe project will be over a 22-kilometre stretch, beginning from Karinchathimoola, the origin of the river in Panavoor grama panchayat, till the Vazhayila bridge. The 31 canals and over 50 rivulets that flow into the river along this stretch, will also be cleaned and check-dams constructed. Strengthening of the boundaries will be done by laying geotextiles and planting trees. \nLocal mission committees have been formed at three levels to coordinate the activities. Last week, thousands of people joined Water Resources Minister Mathew T. Thomas and Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac in a walk along the river titled ‘Puzhayarivu,’ to ensure people’s involvement in the mission. \nIn the Killiyar Oruma programme of April 14 too, Ministers, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, MLAs from all parties, and cultural leaders will take part. The plan is to complete the cleaning-up and construction of check-dams in the months of April and May, to prepare the river for the monsoon. The second phase of the mission will be to protect the river and end the encroachments on both sides.",

      "text": "Home : Caution ahead of earnings season keeps equity markets flat Caution ahead of earnings season keeps equity markets flat in IANS Mumbai, April 11, 2018 Key Indian equity indices settled on a flat-to-positive note on Wednesday after tepid trade throughout the session due to caution ahead of the earning season for January-March 2017-18 starting Friday and heavy selling pressure on oil and gas and banking stocks. However, healthy buying in consumer durables and metal stocks supported the indices. The wider Nifty50 of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) ended the day's trade at 10,417.15 points, up 14.90 points or 0.14 per cent from the previous close. The BSE's barometer 30-scrip Sensex, which opened at 33,970.35 points, settled at 33,940.44 points -- up 60.19 points or 0.18 per cent -- from its previous session's close. The Sensex touched a high of 33,981.54 points and a low of 33,750.74 during the intra-day trade. The BSE market breadth was bearish with 1,506 declines and 1,195 advances. \"Equity markets ended in narrow trade, after a choppy session dragged by financials and oil marketing companies,\" said Dhruv Desai, Director and Chief Operating Officer of Tradebulls.   ADVERTISEMENT According to Deepak Jasani, Head, Retail Research, HDFC Securities: \"Market participants seemed to be cautious ahead of the earnings season beginning on Friday.\" US Federal Reserve will be releasing minutes of its March 20-21, 2018 meeting later on Wednesday, leading to further caution in the markets, Jasani told IANS. Major Asian markets closed on a positive note barring the KOSPI and Nikkei indices, he said, adding that \"European indices like FTSE 100, DAX and CAC 40 are trading in the red.\" On the currency front, the rupee weakened by 33 paise to end at 65.32 against the US dollar. In terms of investments, provisional data with the exchanges showed that foreign institutional investors bought scrips worth Rs 362.30 crore, and the domestic institutional investors purchased stocks worth Rs 111.82 crore. Sector-wise, S&P BSE consumer durables index, gained the most, with 229.80 points followed by the metal index, up 226.33 points and IT index, up 165.70 points. Top losers among the BSE sectors were: S&P BSE oil and gas index, down 335.91 points, banking index down 195 points and finance index, down 26 points. Major Sensex gainers on Wednesday were: TCS, up 2.85 per cent at Rs 3,015.50; Sun Pharma, up 2.50 per cent at Rs 520.70; Reliance Industries, up 1.37 per cent at Rs 929.05; Hindustan Unilever, up 1.29 per cent at Rs 1,408.90 and Kotak Bank, up 1.09 per cent at Rs 1,125.70 per share.

      "text": "Centre cuts excise duty on petrol, diesel by ₹2 a litre New Delhi, Apr 11 \nThe government has not asked state-owned oil firms so far to avoid raising the retail price of petrol and diesel in view of next month’s elections in Karnataka, heads of IOC and HPCL said today. \nThe government was said to have informally directed state-owned fuel retailers not to raise petrol and diesel prices in the run-up to the December 2017 assembly elections in Gujarat. By some accounts, as much as 45 paisa increase warranted in petrol and diesel rates was not passed on. \nThis time around Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) have reportedly been asked to absorb up to Re 1 a litre hike. \n“No, we haven’t heard from the government anything (on dropping daily price revision),” IOC Chairman Sanjiv Singh told reporters on sidelines of the IEF Ministerial meeting here. \nHPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana too said the company is not aware of any directive to oil companies not to pass on the rise in international oil prices. \nOil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan refused to take questions on government dictate that essentially would mean a reversal of reforms. \nShares of IOC fell as much as 7.6 per cent after the news of government asking oil firms to not raise prices broke. HPCL lost as much 8.3 per cent. \nThe government had in June 2010 freed petrol price from its control and the diesel rates were deregulated in October 2014. Prices have since then moved more or less in tandem with international rates barring a few exceptions like the period before a crucial election. \nThe prices at petrol pumps of state-owned fuel retailers like IOC were cut by 1-3 paisa every day in the first fortnight of December. They started moving up immediately after polling for assembly elections in Gujarat concluded on December 14, leading to speculation that government may have asked oil companies to hold on to the prices. \nState-owned oil companies in June last year dumped the 15-year old practice of revising rates on 1st and 16th of every month and instead adopted a dynamic daily price revision to instantly reflect changes in cost. \nIncidentally, oil companies did not change rates at their pumps today. Petrol price continues to cost Rs 73.98 a litre in Delhi, the highest in four years, while diesel rate continues to rule at record levels of Rs 64.96. \nAfter hitting a low of USD 27.1 per barrel in 2016, Brent crude is currently trading around USD 70 level. Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia had last week ruled out any immediate reduction in excise duty to cushion the increases warranted from rise in international oil prices. \nThe BJP-led government had raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre. \nThe government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty, taking away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices. \nIn all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by Rs 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government’s excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15. \nThe central government had cut excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in October 2017, when petrol price reached Rs 70.88 per litre in Delhi and diesel Rs 59.14. Because of the reduction in excise duty, diesel prices had on October 4, 2017 come down to Rs 56.89 per litre and petrol to Rs 68.38 per litre. \nHowever, a global rally in crude prices pushed domestic fuel prices far higher than those levels.

      "text": "Tweet \nNew Delhi: The government has not asked state-owned oil firms so far to avoid raising the retail price of petrol and diesel in view of next month's elections in Karnataka, heads of IOC and HPCL said on Wednesday. The government was said to have informally directed state-owned fuel retailers not to raise petrol and diesel prices in the run-up to the December 2017 assembly elections in Gujarat. By some accounts, as much as 45 paisa increase warranted in petrol and diesel rates was not passed on. \nThis time around Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) have reportedly been asked to absorb up to Re 1 a litre hike. \"No, we haven't heard from the government anything (on dropping daily price revision),\" IOC Chairman Sanjiv Singh told reporters on sidelines of the IEF Ministerial meeting here. \nHPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana too said the company is not aware of any directive to oil companies not to pass on the rise in international oil prices. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan refused to take questions on government dictate that essentially would mean a reversal of reforms. \nShares of IOC fell as much as 7.6 percent after the news of government asking oil firms to not raise prices broke. HPCL lost as much 8.3 percent. \nThe government had in June 2010 freed petrol price from its control and the diesel rates were deregulated in October 2014. Prices have since then moved more or less in tandem with international rates barring a few exceptions like the period before a crucial election. Petrol, diesel rates: Oil companies say no directive from govt to defer price hike. Reuters image. \nThe prices at petrol pumps of state-owned fuel retailers like IOC were cut by 1-3 paisa every day in the first fortnight of December. They started moving up immediately after polling for assembly elections in Gujarat concluded on 14 December, leading to speculation that government may have asked oil companies to hold on to the prices. \nState-owned oil companies in June last year dumped the 15-year old practice of revising rates on 1st and 16th of every month and instead adopted a dynamic daily price revision to instantly reflect changes in cost. \nIncidentally, oil companies did not change rates at their pumps on Wednesday. Petrol price continues to cost Rs 73.98 a litre in Delhi, the highest in four years, while diesel rate continues to rule at record levels of Rs 64.96. \nAfter hitting a low of $27.1 per barrel in 2016, Brent crude is currently trading around $70 level. Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia had last week ruled out any immediate reduction in excise duty to cushion the increases warranted from rise in international oil prices. \nThe BJP-led government had raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs 2 a litre. \nThe government had between November 2014 and January 2016 raised excise duty, taking away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices. \nIn all, duty on petrol rate was hiked by Rs 11.77 per litre and that on diesel by 13.47 a litre in those 15 months that helped government's excise mop up more than double to Rs 2,42,000 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 99,000 crore in 2014-15. \nThe central government had cut excise duty by Rs 2 per litre in October 2017, when petrol price reached Rs 70.88 per litre in Delhi and diesel Rs 59.14. Because of the reduction in excise duty, diesel prices had on October 4, 2017 come down to Rs 56.89 per litre and petrol to Rs 68.38 per litre. \nHowever, a global rally in crude prices pushed domestic fuel prices far higher than those levels. \nUpdated Date: Apr 11, 2018 19:34 PM Tags : #BPCL #Crude Oil Prices #Diesel #Diesel Prices #Fuel Prices #Government #HPCL #IOC #Petrol #Petrol Prices Also See",

      "text": "April 11, 2018 19:20 IST Updated: April 11, 2018 19:20 IST more-in \nThe government has decided to take over the Academy of Medical Sciences, Pariyaram, and the Kerala Cooperative Hospital Complex. \nThe State Cabinet, which met here on Wednesday, resolved to recommend the promulgation of an ordinance by the Governor for the takeover of the institution. The meeting also ratified the draft Bill for the takeover. \nThe Pariyaram Medical College Society had requested the government to take over the institution after it found itself difficult to carry on the administration. The previous LDF regime in 1997 had taken over the medical college but the subsequent UDF government returned the administration to the society. \nThe government has shouldered the burden of repaying the loan taken by the society for the medical college and hospital. \nHealth Minister K.K. Shylaja said the takeover was aimed at providing quality health care to the citizens in north Kerala. A press note quoting her said the medical college with 1,938 employees and 2,500 students would be an asset for the health sector in the State. \n“It is the first self-financing medical college in the cooperative sector and one of the best super speciality hospitals in India with 1,000 beds and 18 operation theatres as well as a dental college, pharmacy college, college of nursing, institute of paramedical sciences, Hridayalaya and public school within the premises.”",

      "text": "When Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) Tax in his Budget 2018 speech, it didn’t went down well with investors. Since then, markets are gyrating.\nThe LTCG tax translates levying a tax on profit generated from assets such as shares, real estate and share-oriented products held for a minimum period of one year from the date of acquisition. The tax regime will be applicable from April 1, 2018.\nThe investors will have to pay 10% tax on profit exceeding Rs 1 lakh made by selling any asset including shares, mutual funds and other shares-oriented schemes. It is noteworthy that there would be no tax deduction on gains accrued upto January 31, 2018.\nThis may not encourage people to invest, but that shouldn’t be the case. Through investments, one can build a huge corpus and look forward to a financially stress-free life. Investments can make you realise your short-term and long-term goals.\nrelated news 4 reasons that indicate it’s time to exit a mutual fund First things first, calculate your taxable income 3 types of mutual funds for short-term, long-term requirements In this scenario, all you need to do is tweak your investment plan a bit. Here’s how\nELSS: The Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) can generate higher returns, even after being taxed. They are a good option for long-term investments and can generate more wealth than traditional investments. They are flexible and come with tax saving benefits.\nDebt funds: It’s time to bring debt funds from the dead. Wealth generated from debt funds are eligible for indexation benefit, which can lower down the effective capital gains. Debt funds clubbed with equity funds can be a good option.\nLTCG can be a rude shock but it should not throw a spanner in your investment plans.",

      "text": "Goan given 500 years More 11 Apr 2018: Goan given 500 years' imprisonment in Dubai in $200mn ponzi-scheme \nSydney Lemos, a prominent Goan who mingled with top names in world football, has had a change of fortunes.\nHe has been sentenced to 500 years in prison by a Dubai court for duping hundreds of investors of $200mn (Rs. 1,300cr).\nBut his wife, who left Dubai last year, vehemently denies the allegations and says they will seek help from Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj.\nAbout: Lemos had a wide reach in the Dubai football scene \nLemos (37), previously a footballer himself, was running FC Bardez, a popular team in Dubai.\nHe hobnobbed with top names in the business, including Zico and Ronaldinho.\nBrazilian superstar Neymar even sent his wife Valany Cardozo a personal video message on her birthday.\nBut his major claim to fame came when he became the main sponsor of FC Goa in the ISL in 2015.\nFC Goa: The FC Goa association gave him standing and legitimacy \nThe move came after Videocon D2H stopped financing FC Goa. Lemos stepped in with a five-year deal at Rs. 3.25cr in the first year.\nThough it was unexpected, it brought Lemos attention as he mixed with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Abhishek Bachchan and Ranbir Kapoor.\nHis firm Exential, which offered investors 120% annual returns upon minimum investment of $25,000, gained legitimacy through association.\nAction: After initial payoffs, the money stopped coming \nInitially, it paid off, investors say. But by March'16, the scheme had collapsed.\nThe Dubai Economic Department sealed its offices in July'16.\nLemos was arrested in December'16, released on bail, then re-arrested in January'17. The same month, Valany returned to India.\nLemos' accounts specialist Ryan de Souza (25), another Goan, was nabbed from the Dubai Airport in February'17 as he was leaving for India.\nStatus: Sydney had genuine problems, wants to help his clients: Wife \nValany, who's accused of removing critical documents from their sealed office in December'17, calls the accusations against Lemos false.\n\"Sydney definitely wants to help the clients,\" she said, adding they faced a \"genuine problem\" when one of their bank accounts was closed in 2015.\nThe only reason he was convicted was because there were 513 complaints, she said, and this isn't the final verdict.",

Today, the country has one of the world's largest domestic solar power programmes, covering 14 per cent of the population,\" said Qimiao Fan, World Bank Country Director for Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal. \n\"Building on its success in using solar energy to provide electricity in rural areas, this financing will also scale up other clean renewable energy options,\" said Fan. \nThe project has already built 10 solar mini-grids in remote areas, including islands and shoals to provide grid-quality electricity. \nThis additional financing will help construct another 30 solar mini-grids. These will provide about 28,000 connections to households and businesses, including small and medium-sized enterprises. \n--IANS",

TNN | Updated: Apr 11, 2018, 13:14 IST Representative Image HYDERABAD: The government will spend Rs 5,480 crore to implement the farmers' investment incentive scheme Rythu Bandhu this season. This was finalised by the finance department after data of 54.4 lakh farmers was handed over to banks by agriculture department officials. The massive data is being examined by banks and agriculture extension officers, who will finally hand over the cheques to farmers by April-end. Notwithstanding the delay in printing of land ownership passbooks and cheques by private agencies, the agriculture department has completed scrutiny of data relating to 9,919 villages. The government is planning to conduct the cheque distribution programme like a festival. \"We submitted farmers' data in three phases to banks and the remaining data relating to 1,000 villages will be presented in a day or two. After the cheques are printed , state-level officials will examine them before the distribution begins. They will take up this programme on April 12-14 at the designated banks,\" principal secretary, agriculture, C Parthasarathi told TOI.

REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo Earlier this week, Achleitner forced out CEO John Cryan after a row that centred on what some describe as Cryan’s ‘indecisiveness’ in cutting jobs and costs, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.\nPressure had built as the group’s share price tumbled in recent months, with problems further compounded by heavy losses.\nAchleitner now hopes the appointment of Christian Sewing, who is expected to outline his plans in the coming weeks, will give fresh impetus to management albeit without any big change in strategy, those people said.\nCryan’s departure, orchestrated by Achleitner, who broke off a family Easter holiday in Peru to travel to New York and London to forewarn some investors, took many other major shareholders by surprise, the sources said.\nThe rushed nature of the replacement, sealed at a hastily convened Sunday meeting of non-executive directors, has prompted criticism of Achleitner and his role at a bank that was once the flagship of Europe’s top economy but is now floundering.\nIt is the second change of CEO under his watch.\n“Achleitner ignored things for too long. He should have given the bank direction,” said Hendrik Leber, a fund manager at one of the bank’s shareholders, Acatis Fondsmanager.\nA spokesman for the bank declined to comment.\nAchleitner had discreetly prepared for the change over many months, the people who spoke to Reuters said.\nBut for those outside the small circle of managers involved, the announcement came unexpectedly, prompting some to question why Cryan had to go as the bank continues a delicate turnaround.\n“Why was it necessary to appoint a new CEO at this point?” said Hans-Christoph Hirt of Hermes EOS, which represents pension funds and other investors, adding that Achleitner had “overseen a number of strategic U-turns” and multiple management changes.\n‘NICE GUY’ Some of the group’s largest shareholders also have similar misgivings about the decision to appoint Sewing, a manager who joined the bank from school and who had a low profile before being appointed as chief executive.\nOne person with knowledge of the meeting where directors were told of the CEO switch said Achleitner presented the change as a done deal, offering no alternative candidate and leaving them with little choice but to reluctantly agree.\nAchleitner, the person said, appeared “irritated” by the discord during what was a tense three-and-a-half hour gathering, where directors, including those representing large shareholders, dialled in from around the globe.\nTranslation of the conversation into different languages further drew out the discussion, as Sewing waited in a room nearby in case he should be asked to join.\nAchleitner has defended his action. “There was lack of speed by the management board in making decisions and executing them,” he told a German newspaper this week.\nOthers echo this view. “John Cryan is nice, a really lovely guy,” said one former colleague, who worked with him at Deutsche.\n“If you tell him there are risks associated with making cuts, he wants to analyse those risks to death before going ahead. Real cost-cutters say: ‘I need 100 heads to roll in this division’.” Cryan, a British former UBS banker, could not be reached for comment.\nBut dissatisfaction over the manner of his replacement may have repercussions for the Austrian financier - Achleitner had preferred to discreetly exercise his influence but now finds himself centre stage.\nAchleitner is already facing a backlash at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting on May 24.\nOne investor, Ralf Kugelstadt, filed a motion to that meeting urging investors to vote against ratifying the supervisory board’s actions for the past year. Such a move is equivalent to calling a vote of no confidence.\n“It is time for all of this fiddling around without a vision to stop. Lead Deutsche Bank into the future and not into irrelevance,” Kugelstadt wrote in his proposal posted on April 9.\nCONUNDRUM Whatever the protest, Achleitner, whose term as chairman continues until 2020, does not intend to resign.\nHe is a seasoned executive, who has survived corporate storms in the past, such as when he helped mastermind insurer Allianz’s 24-billion-euro takeover of Dresdner Bank, a business that later racked up heavy losses before being sold on.\nAchleitner remains influential in German business and sits on the supervisory board of car giant Daimler and Bayer. He shares an office in Munich with Joachim Faber, the chairman of Deutsche Boerse, the country’s stock exchange operator.\nHis wife, Ann-Kristin Achleitner, is an academic who also sits as a non-executive director on the supervisory boards of Deutsche Boerse and reinsurer Munich Re.\nAchleitner has sought to distance himself from Deutsche’s strategic blunders.\nBut Wolfgang Gerke of the Bavarian Financial Centre, a research institute, said he bore responsibility, alongside executives. Asked whether he should resign, he said: “His wife is a friend of mine, but the truth is, yes.”\nIt now falls to Sewing to take up where Cryan left off. The years-old conundrum of whether or not to focus on international investment banking or build a steady if unexciting German retail business remains.\nFor three decades, the bank’s primary focus was building up its investment bank into a global powerhouse. That rapid growth landed the bank in hot water, and since then, the bank has flip-flopped as it tries to define its mission.\nThe bank is conducting a global review of its investment unit and is expected to present early results in weeks.\n“I can imagine that we make adjustments in the investment bank, also in some regions,” Sewing said on national television on his first day in the job.\nBut patience is running out.\n“Deutsche Bank doesn’t just need a change of people, it needs a sustainable strategy to steer it into calmer waters,” said Gerhard Schick, a German lawmaker with the Green party.\n“In this respect, Achleitner, in what he has done, has not really been convincing.”\nFILE PHOTO: Deutsche Bank supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner gives a speech during the Swiss International Finance Forum in Bern, Switzerland June 20, 2017.

      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, during his testimony before the United States Congress, apologised several times for his social media company's failures. After Zuckerberg's \"sorry\", Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hit out at the Congress saying party president Rahul Gandhi should apologise and promise not to manipulate voters.\nWhile Prasad might have targeted Rahul Gandhi, back home Zuckerberg's admission of guilt came quite close to the apology spree by Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal.\nAs far as apologising is concerned, Zuckerberg and Kejriwal seem to have at least one trait in common.\nMARK ZUCKERBERG\nDuring his testimony, the Facebook CEO conceded that his social media company must work harder at ensuring the tools it creates are used in \"good and healthy\" ways. \"We have made a lot of mistakes in running the company,\" he said.\nWhile testifying before the US Senate after a firestorm erupted over Facebook's alleged failure to protect its users' data, Zuckerberg conceded that 2018 is an \"important election year\" in countries including India. He assured that Facebook would do everything to \"protect the integrity\" of the upcoming elections.\nARVIND KEJRIWAL\nZuckerberg may have apologised for the first time but Arvind Kejriwal has earned the dubious distinction of saying \"sorry\" several times and on more than one occasion.\nThe Delhi chief minister apologised perhaps for the first time in 2015. That year his government was sworn in for the second time. Kejriwal repeatedly and profusely apologised to the Delhi voters for having quit power in February 2014 in a huff.\nHe admitted his guilt and promised that he would never quit power ever again.\nLast month, Kejriwal apologised to Shiromani Akali Dal leader Bikram Singh Majithia for having levelled \"unfounded\" allegations related to involvement in drugs trade against the latter.\nSubsequently, the AAP chief went on to say sorry to four other people - Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal, his son Amit Sibal and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.\nJaitley filed a Rs 10-crore defamation suit filed against Kejriwal and five others - Raghav Chadha, Kumar Vishwas, Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh and Deepak Bajpai - of the AAP. They had alleged irregularities and financial bungling in the DDCA when Jaitley was its president between 1999 and 2013.\nSenior AAP leaders said that Arvind Kejriwal was fighting more than 20 defamation cases filed against him in several parts of the country. The apologies were being made to get rid of such cases which were hampering the work of the Delhi government.\nDelhi Deputy Chief Minisrter Manish Sisodia said they, by saying sorry, had not spared time for court but for themselves so that they could fight for people.\nREAD | Zuckerberg 'sorry' for breach, says Facebook will protect integrity of India's elections\nREAD | Congress poster at Cambridge Analytica office leaves party red faced",

      "text": "April 11, 2018 18:08 IST Updated: April 11, 2018 18:11 IST more-in Make-up artist and hairstylist Gayatri says that she enjoys bridal make-up as it gives her an immense satisfaction of making a bride look her best on her wedding day \nGayatri Raghavan did not want to pursue a career in finance, instead she chose to become a make-up artist and hairstylist. “I come from an academic family,” says Gayatri, who is now based in Bengaluru, where she worked for Mac Cosmetics for a year before she became an independent professional. “After my graduation in Commerce, I got married and moved to Germany. I learnt German and was getting offers in finance, but I didn’t want to work in that field.” Eventually she studied at the Pro Academy in Germany. Since then there has been no looking back. She has done major shoots in India for Flipkart, Jet Airways, Toyota, Blu-O, and Amie. \nGayatri’s portfolio of bridal make-up shows her distinct style. She brings out the beauty of brides by highlighting their individuality. While she has done corporate shows, advertisements, and ad films she enjoys wedding shoots the most. “I have a soft corner for it,” she smiles. “For a bride her wedding is her biggest day. So it is personal for me to dress the bride. For me, make-up is not about putting on a product and looking completely different. I like to enhance the face and give brides a subtlety and make them look great. I always look at their eyes, skin and face to ascertain what will look good on them.” \nShe says her first bride was one of her favourite clients. “She will always be special to me. She trusted me and she looked beautiful on her wedding day.” \nWhat were the challenges and joys of starting on her own? Gayatri says: “I thought I am going to start my FB page and that work would just come in. But that didn’t happen. It took a while. I started talking to people and making connections. But the good side is that I get to work when I want and with people I like.” She adds that she had to do a lot of research when she came to India. “I had to learn application techniques while figuring out the Indian skin tone.” And so what kind of make-up is best for the Indian skin? “You should invest in a good concealer. For day make-up use a BB cream or a light foundation. I think mascara is essential because it makes the eyes bright. For night make-up you can apply whatever you want.” \nWhile choosing a foundation, Gayatri says the best way is to draw a line of foundation from the jawline till the end of the neck. “Whatever matches your neck will be the perfect shade.” She emphasizes on taking good care of the skin for make-up to be effective. \nFor hair care, especially in Bengaluru where hard water leads to hair fall, Gayatri says: “As a last rinse, take a litre of drinking water and wash your hair. It does make a difference in reducing hair fall. And you should wash your hair three days in a week.” She recommends using natural products such as coconut oil, eggs and yoghurt as natural conditioners. “Stay away from perming and straightening, it leaves the hair permanently damaged. I wouldn’t recommend it.” \nAs for what are the hits and misses in make-up according to her, Gayatri says: “smokey eyes, highlighting and contouring, and the bold lips trend. But she adds that: these are classics, not cliches.” \nGayatri's Facebook page is Make up and Hair by Gayatri . She can be contacted at 7259854525 or emailed at vr.gayatri@gmail.com.",

A letter shot by KVK Rao, general secretary of AIFSTI to Telangana education minister Kadiyam Srihari among other higher education department officials on Tuesday, highlighted the modus operandi of consultants and public relation officers (PROs). \"The PROs/consultants are purchasing SSC, intermediate, degree certificates from students and parents for 5,000 to 10,000 by assuring them admission in a good college with free hostel or free transportation. These consultants are entering into agreements with the technical institutions which do not comply with any of the All India Council of Technical Education and affiliation norms,\" read the letter. The AIFSTI has warned students and parents to not fall prey to such tactics by consultants and PROs. \"It is the duty of all the authorities to educate and advise the students and parents not to sell their certificates and to visit as many colleges as possible, to assess all the parameters vis-a-vis the fee being charged by the colleges. They can finally take a conscious decision which will safeguard future of their wards,\" the letter said.

      "text": "Australia Shudders Amid Talk of a Chinese Military Base in Its Backyard By 7 Share An official with the United States State Department confirmed the department was aware of the report and was seeking to determine its credibility. The United States has an enduring interest in the security and stability of the Pacific, the official added. The report comes as many Australians have become increasingly alarmed about Chinese influence in the country, with Australian politics recently thrown into turmoil over allegations that China is trying to buy its politicians and sway its elections. Experts say officials in Australia, the United States, and New Zealand are closely watching Beijing as it deepens its influence in the South Pacific through infrastructure projects and loans to smaller nations, and any effort to build military bases in the region would be particularly worrisome. “If it were to happen, and it’s a huge if, it would be an aggressive move in the eyes of Australia, the U.S. and New Zealand,” said Graeme Smith, a Pacific Affairs expert at the Australian National University in Canberra. Vanuatu, an impoverished nation, is considered to be within Australia’s sphere of influence, with Canberra providing it with aid and investment. Australian politicians said that a Chinese base on Vanuatu would be a potential game changer strategically for the region. “It would have not only security but economic consequences for the region, and we should regard it as a wake-up call for Australia,” Senator Penny Wong told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. “It is not in the interest of the region — or in the interests of stability — for there to be increased competition, great power competition, in our region,” she said. Jonathan Pryke, a Pacific islands expert with the Lowy Institute, noted that Vanuatu is home to a wharf built and financed by China that could conceivably be used for military purposes, particularly if Vanuatu has problems repaying the loan. \nContinue reading the main story “They can provide a nice bit of economic leverage over that country,” Mr. Pryke added. Fairfax Media reported that Beijing had recently committed to building a new residence for Vanuatu’s prime minister, Charlot Salwai, as well as other government buildings. Vanuatu has also reportedly been given hundreds of millions in development money by the Chinese. ",

      "text": "The BJP earned over four times as much the Congress in 2016-17 Dilsher Dhillon Apr 11, 2018, 05.22 PM declared an income of ₹10.34 billion while the Congress made ₹2.25 billion. Around 96% of the BJP’s income came from voluntary donations. The BJP declared a total expenditure of ₹7.1 billion in 2016-2017, nearly 86% of which was spent on elections and general propaganda, while the Congress spent ₹3.2 billion. It definitely pays to be in power. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared a gross income of ₹10.34 billion in fiscal 2017, according to a report by the Association of Democratic Reforms, an NGO. This marked a 81% jump in the ruling party’s income from the previous year, owing to a surge in individual donations. As is customary in countries beset by crony capitalism, the ruling party always gets the most donations. The BJP outearned every other national political party in India by a mile. The Indian National Congress, the country’s main Opposition party, reported the second-highest income of ₹2.25 billion, a 14% drop from the previous year. The only other national parties to make more than ₹1 billion were the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which reported a 250% jump in income to ₹1.73 billion, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), whose income fell to ₹1 billion from ₹1.07 billion. The findings are based on the audited accounts submitted by the parties to the Election Commission of India. The deadline for submitting these tax returns was October 30th last year. The country’s two main parties took their time with their accounts. The BJP sent in its audited report in February 2018, while the Congress submitted it last month. The BJP, as usual, was tight-lipped about the actual sources of its revenue. It attributed a staggering 96.4% of its income in 2016-2017 to voluntary donations. The remaining amount came from interests on bank deposits and fees and subscriptions. Meanwhile, the Congress sourced 22.5% of its income from donations and grants while 51% came from the sale of coupons, which involves the issuance of receipts to donors in lieu of a cash contribution, and 19.5% came from the interest accrued on fixed deposits. As per India’s laws, the details of donations less than ₹20,000 did not have to be disclosed - a rule that the BJP and other political parties could have easily exploited by splitting large donations into amounts less than this limit. However, in last year’s Union Budget, Arun Jaitley capped the limit of individual donations at ₹2,000 for the “sake of transparency”. It will be interesting to see what effect this has on these parties’ accounts for 2017-18. In all likelihood, more accounting work will be required. And how did the BJP spend its income in fiscal 2017? It focused its resources on staying in power and winning elections, a notable victory coming in the Uttar Pradesh state elections in March 2017. The BJP declared a total expenditure of ₹7.1 billion in 2016-2017, nearly 86% of which was spent on elections and general propaganda. The Congress struggled to match its rival’s spending power. The Opposition party ending up spending a lot more than it earned, recording a total expenditure of ₹3.2 billion, 46% of which was used to finance its election campaigns. It also declared ₹1.16 billion worth of administrative and general expenses, well above the BJP’s combined expenditure of ₹902 million on administrative and employee costs. Clearly, the BJP has a sizeable chest of cash at its disposal ahead of the 2019 general elections. However, the Congress is not to be counted out. It has amassed its own wealth over 10 stints as the ruling administration since India’s independence, and will spare no expense as it takes on the BJP and allies with other opposition parties next year. More pressing, however, is the murkiness regarding the finances of these parties. An overwhelming majority of their funds come from unspecified sources. Worse still, India’s parties have shown that they have no qualms in being swayed by foreign interests as long as there’s money on the table, with the BJP and Congress going so far as to okay a bill that lets them off the hook for all the illegal foreign donations that they have received since 1976. The Association of Democratic Reforms recommends that all details of political donations should be made available to public under the Right-to-Information Act, as is the case in a host of countries such as the US, Germany, France, Italy, Japan Bhutan and Nepal. It also says that much like a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 that says an election candidate’s application should be completely filled, the Election Commission of India should enforce a rule that requires parties to disclose the source of all their donations above ₹20,000 in their tax forms. Meanwhile, the Election Commission is said to be assessing Arun Jaitley’s electoral bonds proposal which is targeted at curbing cash contributions, but the scheme will only muddy the waters further by preserving the anonymity of donors. The bonds, which can be purchased from the State Bank of India, do not bear the name of the buyer, and as a result, the political party which receives the funds will not be able to identify the source but both of them will have to account for it. The idea is for banks to act as intermediaries of the political donation process. The source of any political party’s power should be the support it receives from the common electorate, not the funds it receives from wealthy donors and businesses, both domestic and foreign. There needs to be greater transparency in political funding in India, especially with regards to corporate donations. Anything otherwise is an affront to the principles of democracy",

      "text": "New Delhi, Apr 10 -- Scam-hit Punjab National Bank is among some government organisations which ignored the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) advice to act against its allegedly corrupt staff, the anti-corruption body has stated in a new report.\nThe non-compliance of the advice has been mentioned in the CVC's annual report for 2017 tabled in Parliament recently.\nThe report comes at a time when the bank is facing multiple agency probe in the over Rs 13,000 crore loan fraud allegedly committed by billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle, Mehul Choksi , the promoter of Gitanjali Gems .\nThe latest CVC report refers to a case in which the PNB sanctioned a Cash Credit (CC) limit of Rs 200 lakh and Term Loan (TL) of Rs 150 lakh to a firm for setting up a manufacturing unit in Dehradun against mortgage of property that was find unviable.\n\"The loan was secured by hypothecation of stocks, plant and machinery mortgage of factory land valued at Rs 42 lakh and mortgage of another immovable property as collateral security situated in Delhi.\n\"Further CC limit of Rs 150 lakh & TL of Rs 50 lakh was sanctioned for setting up Unit II. Charge over existing collateral security was extended and a second immovable property in Delhi was also mortgaged,\" the CVC said.\nIt has been observed that the bank accepted the two properties situated in Delhi \"without ensuring genuineness of property papers as well as its geographical location\", it said.\nIn case of one property, the seller was not the rightful owner, while the other was found to be a 'gram sabha' land and thus both mortgages were found to be defective and not enforceable, the Commission said, without mentioning when the deals took place.\n\"The bank later reported that the chain of title deeds at the time of equitable mortgage was not critically examined independently by the concerned official and the report of advocate was simply relied upon,\" it said.\nThe Commission advised initiation of major penalty proceedings against the senior manager of the PNB. Out of 14 charges, the inquiry officer has held only two charges as proved and one charge as partly proved.\n\"On conclusion of inquiry, the disciplinary authority proposed to levy a minor penalty of 'censure',\" the CVC said.\nThe Commission decided to treat the case as a deviation from its advice and to report the same in the annual report, it said.\nGovernment departments like Railways Ministry, Department of Telecommunications, Civil Aviation Ministry, Road, Transport and Highways Ministry, Exim Bank of India, Finance Ministry, Steel Ministry, Ministries of Coal and Defence, and Delhi Jal Board which also did not folow the CVC advice in some cases against allegedly corrupt staff.\n\"Non-acceptance of the Commission's advice or non-consultation with the Commission vitiates the vigilance process and weakens the impartiality of vigilance administration,\" the CVC said in the report.\nGiving details of another case, the Commission said a Group General Manager (GGM) of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Ltd (IRCTC) was caught red-handed by the CBI in his office demanding and accepting illegal gratification.\nThe Commission had advised prosecution and initiation of major penalty proceedings on January 15, 2013. On being approached for reconsideration after four years, the Commission reiterated its advice on August 28, 2017, it said.\nThe disciplinary authority did not implement the Commission's advice and issued administrative warning to the then GGM of IRCTC on August 30, 2017 for lapse regarding non-intimation of transaction of certain movable properties.\n\"The procedure laid down for consultation has also not been followed before deviating from the advice of the Commission,\" the report said.

      "text": "Opinion It’s Impossible to be sure of anything but Death and Taxes – Christopher Bullock \nGovernments and Kings before them for centuries have been able to run administration through efficient use of taxes. But taxes are also a friction for business which generally entails that they will go to any extant possible to avoid getting taxed. \nApple, Microsoft, Google among other Tech Giants, to escape the clutches of the US Tax Administration have for years sold their products outside the US by routing it through one of the many tax havens / low tax countries. Apple for example has 94% of its total cash outside United States. \nOnly after the recent tax cuts announced by Trump have many a company announced their intention to bring back the corpus in the light of the new lower tax regime. \nIndia at one point of time had a tax slab which taxed income at 85% in the year 1970 – 71. From that point, we have come a long way but given the high incidence of Indirect taxes, overall tax impact remains high. \nThe social mind set thought of gains being accrued by businessmen without effort hasn’t gone away despite 3 decades of liberalization. Post the 2018 budget when the Government announced Long Term Gains from Stocks would be taxed at 10%, the Finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia commented that “Capital gains don’t accrue from any effort”. \nIn his view, very fact we are taxing capital gains at just 10% versus the highest slab of Income tax being 30% is something that needs to be looked at favourably. \nGenerating capital gains from stock market is neither easy nor effortless. Even before the implementation of the Long Term Tax, we had multiple other taxes that are levied on those trading the stock markets and this was one more addition to that list. The Tax-Saving Foreign Investor \nWhile we Indians have no option but to grin and bear each and every additional tax that is levied by the government, those outside India are neither interested in grinning or bearing the taxes. \nWhile access to Indian Markets is easy compared to earlier times, smaller players were unable to participate. With an intention to provide players elsewhere the opportunity to trade on the Indian Indices, the stock exchanges has entered into agreements for trading derivative products on Nifty 50 with Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX), Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc. (CME) and Osaka Exchange Inc. (OSE), Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX). \nSingapore, Cyprus and Mauritius were tax-safe for Indian investments till recently. Investing in Indian stocks or derivatives from any of these locations allowed foreign investors to get all their gains without paying any Indian taxes. But recently, the government has renegotiated the treaties and will start imposing taxes on the gains made by them, with a smaller amount now and full taxes after March 2019. \nWith longer trading hours and lower taxes, Singapore emerged as a frontier for finance in Asia and it was no surprise to see volume of transactions on Nifty 50 pickup tremendously. So popular was the contract that SGX derived nearly 10% of its derivatives revenue from just trading Nifty 50 . \nAnd, of the total Nifty derivative volume, there was as much being traded on the SGX as there was on the NSE. Note that Singapore charges no capital gains taxes, so anyone buying the Nifty there is more advantaged than buying it in India. But there were stock futures! \nWhile the derivative of Nifty 50 is the largest Index that is traded on the bourses, on the NSE, total volume of Nifty ranges from 12-15%. More than 70% of volume arises from Individual Stock futures which is the bread and butter for the Exchange. (India is the largest single stock futures market in the world) \nStock futures are relatively more liquid than the cash market, but give you no access to voting rights or dividends. However, they have lower settlement risk, do not require you to transfer shares, and can be entered or exited relatively fast. \nWhile stealing away a large part of Nifty 50 volumes to its side was a pain but one still acceptable, when SGX decided to introduce individual stock futures, it was the last straw on the camel’s back and the exchanges panicked. \nIn their panic, they turned towards the one thing they felt can unsettle SGX – cancelling the license to use Nifty 50 which is a trademark of the National Stock Exchange. \nThe Nifty 50 is a brand, the fact remains that those trading the product least care about the name – it’s the underlying index that is the reason for them to trade. You could call it the Mitron-50 and yet trading wouldn’t diminish an inch. \nSGX has now chosen the later path – it will call its Nifty 50 Derivative Product as an India Index while basing it on Nifty 50 and using Nifty 50 closing price for settlement. The NSE can stop them using the name “Nifty”. But they can’t trademark the price as which the index closed. And that is all the SGX needs! \nWith one move, SGX has ensured seamless continuation for the product while also saving up on the License fee it was paying ISSL, which is the Index company of NSE. They’ll use the price of the Nifty, but call it the India Index and allow derivative trading. You can buy that index and, on the same expiry date as the Nifty, you will be able to settle it in cash with the price of the Nifty. The same thing, without the licensing fee. Don’t Rock The Financial Boat? \nThanks to technology, trading has become Universal. One can trade any market across the world without having to move from his seat. Given that luxury, why would anyone want to shift to places (as this move evinced to GIFT city) is something that makes little sense. \nChina is trying hard to make Shanghai the financial hub for Asia, something that is now shared or rather competed between Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. \nLondon used to be and continues to be a Financial hub for Europe, but the impending BREXIT has put a hold on the future of London as the place to do business. \nThe BSE despite all its efforts has little to show in the Derivative markets since Liquidity begets Liquidity and there is no reason to chase Liquidity in exchanges where it cannot be found even if it was a bit cheaper than elsewhere. \nIndia can try to attract back the volumes that have been lost elsewhere by simplifying red tape as also reducing the taxes. Higher taxes have always meant an arbitrage and those who are in a position to take advantage of the arbitrage will never sit tight. Worldwide, it’s accepted that if a foreign entity has capital gains in your country, you don’t tax him – his home country does. If you as an Indian resident invest in the US, it won’t charge you taxes on capital gains, but India will tax you. But India taxes foreign investors’ capital gains in India – which obviously hurts them. And if someone like the SGX offers them the Indian index without needing to pay Indian taxes, that’s a good choice to make. \nFor now, SGX has won his round of the battle. Given International Law, it’s unlikely that NSE can force SGX to withdraw from their current decision. But if and when India lowers taxes, opens up more hours for trading, and reduces effort for participation, there is no reason why someone will prefer to trade elsewhere when the major volumes are in the exchange that it trades on. Rocking the financial boat by introducing taxes will, over time, force people to move to alternatives that are tax free. The SGX just made itself an alternative again, even if ethically outside the line. Now, tell them about it:",

      "text": "* Rouble, lira woes moderately weigh on forint, zloty * Polish central bank head says rates may stay low for years * Polish long-term yields lowest since autumn 2016 * Czech government raises economic growth forecasts (Recasts with Polish central bank decision and comments) By Sandor Peto BUDAPEST, April 11 (Reuters) - Central European stocks and currencies fell on Wednesday along with other emerging markets as geopolitical tensions rose. The region's main equity indexes dropped by 0.1 to 0.2 percent, except for a quarter percent rise in Budapest. In currency markets, the Polish zloty and Hungarian forint both eased by 0.1 percent against the euro by 1523 GMT, and the leu eased 0.15 percent. The Polish central bank kept interest rates on hold as expected, and Governor Adam Glapinski said he saw no reason to change record low interest rates in the next two years. The zloty briefly gained after he said the currency's strengthening had not caused problems in the economy. But it gave up ground as Glapinski said there were no reasons to think about policy tightening, and that a moment may come when action in the opposite direction would be advisable. \"We believe that, given recent development of inflation rate, a rate hike is less and less likely to happen in 2019,\" Erste Group analyst Katarzyna Rzentarzewska said in a note. \"We decided to change our baseline scenario to no policy rate hike next year as well.\" After a surprise decline in Polish annual inflation to 1.3 percent in March, the central bank said inflation would stay close to its target in the next few years. Polish 5- and 10-year government bonds were bid at their lowest yields since autumn 2016. The 10-year yield dipped below 3 percent, to 2.97 percent. Hungary's 10-year government bond yield dropped by 3 basis points to 2.38 percent. It has declined by almost 20 basis points since Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party won elections on Sunday, ensuring policy predictability. \"Thursday's auctions could be smoothly sold despite the lower yields levels,\" one trader said. The Czech crown traded steady, bucking the weakening of its regional peers. The Czech central bank is expected to continue to raise interest rates. The Czech Finance Ministry raised its growth forecasts for this year and next on Wednesday.

      "text": "Tweet \nNew Delhi: In a bid to quicken award of licences, the Cabinet on Wednesday allowed ministers of finance and petroleum to award oil and gas blocks to their winners in the ongoing auction, bids for which are due on 2 May. \nTill now, only the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister had the powers to approve award of an block or area for exploration and production of oil and gas. \n\"In line with the Government initiative of ease of doing business, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given its approval for delegating the powers to Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Finance Minister to award the blocks/contract areas to successful bidders,\" an official statement said. \nThe two ministers will approve the award based on the recommendations of a panel of secretaries, called the Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECS). \nThe delegation of power is for Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) bid rounds under the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP). Presently, the first round of OALP is underway, with bids for 55 exploration blocks on offer for prospecting of oil and gas due on 2 May. These blocks are to be awarded by July. \n\"Under HELP, blocks are to be awarded twice in a year. Therefore, this delegation of powers will expedite the decision making process on awarding blocks and give a boost to the initiative of ease of doing business,\" the statement said. Ease of doing business: Cabinet delegates powers to oil, finance ministers to award oil blocks. Reuters image. \nIndia had, in July last year, allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. Under this policy, called HELP, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence. \nThe EoIs can be put in at anytime of the year but they are accumulated twice annually. The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage. \nHELP replaced the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) where government carved out areas and bid them out. \nUnder the NELP policy, ECS make recommendations to Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for award of blocks after considering the bid evaluation criteria (BEC) and conducting negotiations with the bidders wherever necessary. \n\"The entire process, including inter-ministerial consultations (IMC) is quite lengthy and time consuming. In consonance with the Government initiative of 'Ease of Doing Business', it is desirable to shorten the duration of time taken for award of the blocks/contract Areas,\" the statement said. \nUnder HELP, the competitive bidding will be continuous and blocks will be awarded twice a year. \nHELP offers revenue sharing contract, single licence for exploration and production of conventional as well as unconventional hydrocarbon resources and marketing and pricing freedom. \nOALP under HELP, is main innovative feature wherein investor can carve out blocks of their own interest and submit an Expression of Interest (Eol) throughout the year. Based on the areas for which expression of interest has been expressed bidding will be conducted every 6 months. \n\"Government received an overwhelming response in first Eol cycle of OALP which started on 1 July, 2017 and closed on 15 November, 2017. In the first Bid round, 55 blocks, having an area of 59,282 sq km spread across 11 states have been offered for bidding. The bidding process is being handled through a secured and dedicated e-bidding portal,\" it added. \n 50  50 PM Tags : #Cabinet #Finance Ministry #HELP #Hydrocarbon Exploration And Licensing Policy #NELP #Oil Blocks Auction #Oil Ministry #Open Acreage Licensing Policy #Prime Minister Narendra Modi Also See",

As many as 70,000 families have benefited under the THP programme till so far. \n“The World Bank wants us to scale up the THP programme in the states of Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. We hope to be able to bring close to 3 lakh underprivileged families under this programme in the next five years,” Ghosh told newspersons on the sidelines of the ‘Development Day’ celebration of Bandhan-Konnagar here on Wednesday. \nTHP programme has been implemented in Assam, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Tripura. State governments of Rajasthan and Jharkhand have tied up with Bandhan-Konnagar, providing them financial support for the implementation of the programme in certain districts of the State, he said. \nThe NGO spends close to Rs 25,000-30,000 per family on an average during the 24-months programme. Apart from World Bank funding support, Bandhan Bank has earmarked close to 2 per cent of its CSR spend on the programme. It also receives funding support from corporates like ITC, HDFC and Indigo, among others. \nUnder the 24-months THP programme, the NGO identifies hardcore poor families who have not had access to traditional finance initiatives and provides them with a productive livelihood asset such as poultry, handicrafts, sewing machine or helps them set up a shop thereby creating opportunity for sustainable living.

      "text": "Amid ballooning bad loans of banks, credit scams and scandals around nepotism in loan advances, a top Dalal Street voice says Indian companies have never been a profitable proposition to bank with.\nLending to corporates in India has never been a profitable activity. It was not so 20 years ago or 10 years ago, it is not so now. Whether the private sector banks do it or public sector banks do it, nobody really makes money by lending to corporates, says Saurabh Mukherjea, Chief Executive Officer, Ambit Capital.\nIndia’s 39 listed banks have over the years amassed huge non-performing assets, which stood at Rs 8,86,074 crore at the end of December quarter. Nineteen of these banks had gross NPAs (as percentage of total loans) in excess of 10 per cent.\nIn recent times, top PSU lender PNB has got embroiled in a Rs 14,000 crore loan fraud involving a diamond merchant, while top private lender ICICI Bank has been dogged by a controversy over alleged nepotism at the top in advancing large advances to a corporate group.\nBanking regulator RBI this past fortnight made private lender Axis Bank reduce a four-year term extension given to its CEO to one year in view of the bank’s poor performance and deteriorating asset quality.\nThere is a big structural issue here, says Mukherjea, known for not mincing words when it comes to markets.\nIf we are really going to move forward as a country, we need to figure out whether the bankruptcy regime can deliver justice for creditors. Lending money to large companies and not getting it back cannot be the basis for building a large free market economy, he said.\nIn recent years, Indian lenders have been shunning the corporate sector and instead trying to swell their retail books, trying to build steady books.\nStock investors, too, have been favouring consumer lenders over their commercial-focused peers in view of the surge in bad loans.\nThe annual credit requirement of domestic businesses is estimated at around Rs 18 lakh crore. Until FY16, the banking system used to meet more than half of this credit requirement, but that share has come down steadily over the past two years.\nReserve Bank of India’s annual report for 2016-17 showed banks’ share in new corporate credit slumped to 35 per cent, while non-bank sources met 65 per cent. As banks tighten their purse strings, India Inc is increasingly turning to the bond market, non-banking finance companies ( NBFCs ) and foreign direct investors to raise funds.\nIndia’s bond market is nascent, but in recent times regulators and the government have tried to make it more robust. The share of bond market’s contribution to the overall fund raising has picked up significantly in last three years.\nIn FY17, India Inc raised Rs 3.16 lakh crore through public issues and private placements of corporate bonds (including commercial paper), marking a 56 per cent jump and making up 22 per cent of the total corporate credit requirement.\nMukherjea says cleaning up the banking system hinges a lot on the bankruptcy code. “Can it give creditors a better regime via which they can get their money back? The NPA issues that we are still contending with are four-five years old.”\nAs more and more loan default cases tumble out of the closet, the jury is still out on whether the NPA crisis has hit its peak.\n“I do not think we have maxed out on NPAs. They will keep rising through most of FY19,” says Mukherjea.\nMukherjea’s boss at Ambit Capital, Ashok Wadhwa, recently made a call to fellow financial intermediaries, saying “We carry a very important responsibility to make sure that we give capital in the hands of people who will allocate it responsibly. If we do a thorough exercise and assist people who allocate capital responsibly, a large part of the fraud will go away. Those who commit fraud leave a track behind. Nobody starts committing fraud overnight.”\nMukherjea insists corporate credit quality has to improve.\nHe also regretted that while most of these large banks are owned by institutional investors, the latter have not been proactive in bringing about changes in management quality.\nInvestors have punished banking stocks harshly in recent times and they have fallen to levels where some analysts tend to see value buying opportunity.\nBut Mukherjea says the time has not come to load up on them, especially those banks with a heavy corporate loan books, whether public or private.\nHe also called for a change in attitude among investors, who would be very discreet about investing only in those companies where the managements are top quality, governance standards are high, accounts are believable.",

      "title": "Four southern govts say terms of reference of 15th Finance Commission unfair: Meet brings back North versus South debate",
      "text": "Tweet \nThree non-BJP ruled southern states and Union Territory Puducherry came out against the Terms of Reference stipulated by the Centre in the 15th Finance Commission for devolution of funds to states. At a conclave of finance ministers of southern states held in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday, Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry said that the Terms of Reference (ToR) was in contradiction to the principles of Federalism enshrined in the Constitution and also would result in revenue loss to performing states. \nThe ministers from the four southern states also strongly opposed the ToR recommendation to use the 2011 Census to calculate population for allocation of Union tax revenue in place of 1971 Census, which was used by previous Finance Commissions. \nHowever, AIADMK-ruled Tamil Nadu and TRS-ruled Telangana opted out of the conference, hosted by Kerala to discuss issues of common concern with respect to the 15th Finance Commission. Briefing reporters on the deliberations of the conclave, Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac said a similar conference would be held at Visakhapatnam either in April end or May first week to finalise a memorandum seeking changes in the ToR.

PTI \n\"We will see that Tamil Nadu and Telangana along with more states like West Bengal, Odisha, Punjab and Delhi attend that conference,\" Isaac said. Stating that all states would be affected, he said BJP-ruled states were also welcome to the conference. \nHowever, he expressed doubt about their participation as ToR was drawn up by the BJP government at the Centre. The memorandum would be submitted either to the President or to 15th Finance Commission Chairman, he said. \nSince its formation in November 2017 , the 15th Finance Commission has been a matter of contention among the southern states. The Finance Commission is a crucial constitutional set-up which decides every five years the ratio in which Central tax revenue should be divided among the different states. \nAll the states and Union Territories in India are collectively allocated 42 percent of the Central taxes collected each financial year. The remaining 58 percent is for the Centre to use for national purposes. But the ratio in which the 42 percent gets divided among the different states is decided by the Finance Commission. On 27 November, 2017, the Ministry of Finance issued a notification constituting the 15th Finance Commission under the chairmanship of NK Singh. \nIn the same notice, one of the ToR stated that the \"Commission shall use the population data of 2011 while making its recommendations\". Traditionally, the previous Finance Commissions used population data from the 1971 Census as a standard. In fact, Lok Sabha constituencies were also divided based on this data and are set to remain frozen this way until 2026. The reason the 1971 Census was used as the standard is as it was the last Census before aggressive family control initiatives were implemented. \nAfter Tuesday's meeting, there were few who thought that there was an attempt to reduce the Centre's share to states through the 15th Finance Commission, he said. \"If this is allowed to succeed, states would become glorified municipalities,\" Isaac said. The 15th Finance Commission is expected to visit the state in May, he said. Issac also said the conclave was the beginning of a debate on Centre-State relations. \nThe North-South debate \nThe decision to include 2011 Census was first introduced in the 14th Finance Commission , which gave a 10 percent weightage to the 2011 Census while allocating the Central tax revenue. Like this piece in The Wire noted, the political consensus was that the ratio of distribution cannot be arrived at based on current population after asking states to implement family planning measures . \nThe argument the southern states are making is that in the decades between 1971 and 2011, these states saw a steady decline in population growth rate, whereas northern states showed no such sign. The contention made by leaders like MK Stalin and Siddaramaiah is that using the 2011 Census data would result in a much-reduced flow of Central funds to the state, which they term as \"punishment\" for investing in education and health schemes to reduce the fertility rates and see an uptick in literacy rates. \n\"We are all aware that the terms of reference of the 15th Finance Commission have created apprehension about principles of fairness and equity in the distribution of national resources for development,\" Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Tuesday while inaugurating the conclave. Attacking the BJP-led NDA government, he said ToR was unprecedented in asking the Commission to consider proposing performance-based incentives beyond those relating to fiscal responsibility, population and devolution to local bodies. \n\"This reflects the viewpoint and ideological inclinations of the Central government and are attempts to micro-manage the fiscal domain of states',\" he said. Andhra Pradesh finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said they were not blaming the Finance Commission or its composition. They were against ToR 'unilaterally' stipulated by the Centre without consulting states, he said and demanded that it be reframed after discussions. \nOne of the ToR asks the Finance Commission to incentivise \"efforts and progress made in moving towards replacement rate of population growth\". Joint secretary of the 13th Finance Commission V Bhaskar noted in The Economic and Political Weekly that the replacement level fertility rate is defined as the total fertility rate (TFR) of 2.1. Out of the 29 states in India, 18 have already achieved the desired replacement rate of 2.1 or less, including all the southern states. \nFemale literacy rates in states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu are much higher than in states like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. This shows a correlation between education and health; states with better literacy seem better prepared to implement family planning measures. \nAs The Wire noted in its report , between 1971 and 2011, Tamil Nadu and Kerala showed an absolute population growth of 56 percent and 75 percent respectively — the lowest among all the states. Most other states showed an increase in the population growth exceeding 100 percent. Uttar Pradesh's showed an absolute population growth of 138.02 percent, while Jammu and Kashmir recorded the highest at 171.82 percent. \nWhen the 14th Finance Commission introduced the change in ratio by including the 2011 Census data, it translated to a revenue loss of Rs 6,000 crore for Tamil Nadu, 19 percent compared to the 13th Finance Commission's allocation ratio, making it the worst affected state. If the 2011 Census data is solely used by the 15th Finance Commission, it could result in a loss of nearly 70 percent of Central tax revenue it was allocated by the 13th Finance Commission, the report further stated. \nIn a statement on Wednesday, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley termed the controversy over the finance commission’s recommendations “needless” . The Union finance minister pointed out that the 14th Finance Commission, which increased the share of states’ revenue to 42 percent from 32 percent, had already set a precedent by giving 10 percent weightage to the 2011 census data. He added that the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission includes a provision for rewarding with special incentives states that have done well in terms of population control. \"There is no inherent bias or mandate in the ToR of the 15th Finance Commission which can be construed as discriminatory against the states which made good progress in population control,\" Jaitley said. \nWith inputs from agencies \nPublished Date: Apr 11, 2018 16:22 PM | Updated Date: Apr 11, 2018 16:22 PM Tags : #15th Pay Commission #2011 Census #Andhra Pradesh #ConnectTheDots #India #Kerala #North India #Pinarayi Vijayan #Puducherry #South India #Tamil Nadu #Tax Benefits #Telangana #Thomas Issac Also See",

Reuters | Apr 11, 2018, 10:48 IST Pakistan’s capital market regulator will introduce seven new standards covering a variety of Islamic finance transactions, as it fast-tracks the adoption of rules to help streamline industry practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan ( SECP ) said it had opened a two-week public consultation period for the standards, which are to be issued by the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI). The sharia standards cover areas including indices, liquidity tools, capital protection and agency agreements, and follow three other AAOIFI standards adopted in February. The SECP published governance rules last month to cover sharia-compliant companies and securities, and it has also amended rules governing the issuance of Islamic bonds, or sukuk. The sukuk funding format is attracting a wider number of issuers, such as Agha Steel Industries , which is planning to tap the market to raise 5 billion rupees ($43.3 million). Javedan Corporation plans to sell sukuk worth 3 billion rupees for a middle-income housing project, and Pakistan Services Ltd intends to issue sukuk worth 7 billion rupees to finance construction of a hotel in the city of Mirpur.

      "title": "Students should build the four positive C’s- Character, Calibre, Capacity and Conduct, Say Venkaiah Naidu",
      "text": "GREATER NOIDA: BIMTECH’S Convocation Day was celebrated with much pomp and show on 11 th April, 2018 with 423 students being awarded their postgraduate degrees. The students belonged to different streams which included post graduate diploma- General/ Insurance/Retail management and International business. The function was held with a huge gathering in India Exposition Mart, Greater Noida.\nAs an eminent political figure, Vice President – Venkaiah Naidu gained prominence as a brilliant orator, who vigorously championed the cause of the farmers and the development of backward areas. Previously, he served as the Minister of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation, Urban Development and Information and Broadcasting in Modi’s Cabinet.\nAccording to Venkaiah Naidu, “Twenty first century India has got some extraordinary talent which the youth must upgrade from time to time so that they grab opportunities that will help them to excel in the corporate world. He laid emphasis on the fact that students should build the four positive C’s- Character, Calibre, Capacity and Conduct.” He further coined words such as “Reform, Perform, and Transform” to encourage the students to become worthy citizens of the country.\nThe students of batch 2016-18 felt really delighted and privileged on being given their diplomas by the Vice President himself. And the message that the honourable vice president gave to the passing batch was that education should not be for commission instead it should instil values. Also he said that talented youth should assume the role of being job creators instead of being job seekers. This process might give temporary pain but will deliver long term gains. He quoted former president of India Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and said “That one should aim high and work hard for it”.\nLastly he appreciated BIMTECH for its various endeavours and said that knowledge has no frontiers and one must care for the ones close to us and specially work for the betterment of the society.\nDr. H. Chaturvedi, Director, BIMTECH presented the annual report and gave his blessings to the students.\nIt was a day of mixed emotions for all the students who were passing out .On one hand they were elated on getting their diplomas and posed happily with their batch mates in their full black convocation attire which had them wearing their academic caps and black robes, whereas on the other hand they were emotional about going away from a place in which they had strings of memories attached and which had taught them a lot.\nThe following students were felicitated on the occasion for excellence in academic and extracurricular activities:\nGold Medal Awarded to Aditya Vardhan for Securing Overall First Position In PGDM Gold Medal Awarded to Shallika Singh for Securing Overall First Position In PGDM (IB) Gold Medal Awarded to Yashaswi Agrawal for Securing Overall First Position In PGDM (IBM) Gold Medal Awarded to Mr. Praveen Kumar A for Securing Overall First Position In PGDM (RM) Special Medal Awarded to Sonali Gupta For Securing First Position In The ‘Marketing’ Specialization Stream In PGDM Special Medal Awarded to Roncy Sara Thomas for Securing First Position In The ‘Operations’ Specialization Stream In PGDM Special Medal Awarded to Mr. Aditya Vardhan for Securing First Position In The ‘Finance’ Specialization Stream In PGDM Special Medal Awarded to Ms. Divya Negi for Securing First Position In The ‘Human Resource’ Specialization Stream In PGDM Dr. C.B.Gupta Memorial Medal – 2018, For All-Round Best Performance Among Male Students, Awarded To Mr. Praveen Kumar A Smt.Yashoda Jaju Memorial Medal – 2018, For All-Round Best Performance Among Female Students, Awarded To Shallika Singh Smt.

      "text": "Economy China opens up auto, financial sectors as Trump tariff war shows results With the current move, foreign financial institutions will get the chance to compete with domestic players in market whose size is estimated at $40 trillion. By : Jijo Jacob Apr 11, 2018 15:30 IST Photo taken on July 6, 2016 shows the displayed Jaguar XE car at the 7th International Auto Exhibition 2016 in Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province. IANS \nChina announced on Wednesday measures aimed at opening up its financial sector in the midst of a raging trade war with the United States. The measures include the decision to remove foreign equity ceilings in key financial sectors. \nThe announcement by Chinese central bank governor Yi Gang at the Boao Forum for Asia followed President Xi Jinping's conciliatory tone at the 'Asian Davos' a day earlier. Xi, locked in a sticky trade war with US President Donald Trump, surprised the business forum when he said China would lead the efforts to \"make economic globalization, more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.\" \nFollowing it up, People's Bank governor Yi Gang signaled the removal of foreign ownership caps for Chinese banks, raised foreign equity stake in brokerages and fund management firms to 51 percent and offered more integration Chinese stock markets with the rest of the world. He also said equity ceilings in brokerages and asset management companies will be lifted completely in three years. \nThese measures are significant at a time when China faces accusations over muted growth of foreign bank operations in the country. Currently, a single foreign institution can't hold more than 20 percent stake in a Chinese bank. Also global banks cannot own more than 49 percent of local securities joint ventures. China's entry into the WTO in 2001 opened the doors of foreign banks into the country but their presence is limited due to stringent policies, while the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co have had to shut down operations. Close Why Trumps trade war could kill US jobs \nWith the current move, foreign financial institutions will get the chance to compete with domestic players in market whose size is estimated at $40 trillion. While Chinese companies have been aggressively bidding for foreign firms, severe restrictions back home had denied reciprocity to global businesses. This disparity, a ballooning trade surplus and violation of intellectual property rights formed the core of Trump's grouse about the Chinese, which eventually spawned the ugly trade war last month. \nIn the securities and futures sector, as well as in the fund management companies, the new proposal is to lift the foreign investment limits to 51 percent from 49 percent. Three years down the line, there will be no limits. In the life insurance companies, the limit will be hiked to 51 percent from 50 percent currently, and the restrictions will be totally lifted after three years. \nChina's Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao had said in November that a plan was on the anvil under which restrictions on investment in the financial sector would be eased. Following that, in February, the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) unveiled guidelines that paved the way for foreign banks to invest in Chinese banks and open new branches. \nThe central bank governor's announcement of more reforms that ensure easier and broader economic ties between China and the rest of the world closely followed the remarks by President Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum on Tuesday. \nOne of the significant declarations by Xi was that China would open up its car industry to foreign manufacturers, which he cited as the proof of a \"new phase of opening up\" in the Chinese economy. \nWhile referring to the trade war, he condemned \"cold War mentality and zero-sum game\" terming them obsolete and outdated. Xi then promised his country will \"significantly\" reduce import tariffs on foreign cars and lower duties of other products. \n\"We have a genuine desire to increase imports and achieve greater balance of international payments under the current account,\" Xi said. \nBalancing trade with US \nThe promise came hours after Trump hit out at China in a tweet that explained the lopsided nature of business between the two financial superpowers. \"When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade. No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE - going on for years!,\" Trump said. \nXi's statement gave a shot in the arm for the US stocks, with auto majors leading the gains. While Tesla gained 5.2 percent, General Motors rose 3.3 percent, Fiat Chrysler 2 percent and Ford Motor was up 1.8 percent. \nOn Wednesday, central bank governor Yi emphasized that the financial sector reforms were also meant to balance trade with the US in a better way. \"I would say with financial and service industries opening up, the US in the future would have more comparative advantage in service trade ... So that when we have goods trade and services trade, these two would balance out as a result,\" he said. \nWith Xi standing down on the aggressive rhetoric of fighting till the end to counter US trade sanctions, it certainly looks like Trump's tariff war has started getting results.",

PTI @moneycontrolcom \nOnline recruitment activity registered 12 percent increase in March with demand for finance and healthcare professionals witnessing a significant uptrend, says a report. \nThe Monster Employment Index India stood at 292 in March as compared to 261 in the year-ago month. \n\"The economic reforms by the government seem to have started impacting the economy in a positive manner and the online recruitment activity around key sectors such as production and manufacturing can possibly be attributed to it,\" said Abhijeet Mukherjee, CEO, Monster.com- APAC & Gulf. \nThe report noted that finance and accounts, and healthcare professionals saw highest growth year-on-year at 32 percent and 31 percent, respectively. \n\"The demand for professionals in finance & accounts can also be a resultant of the massive opportunity created by GST reforms for people with know-how of the new tax regime,\" Mukherjee added. \nHe further said the digital revolution is mirroring the substantial growth across sectors, thereby escalating opportunities and reshaping the fundamental nature of work and iterating the constant need to upskill. \nDuring the reported month, e-recruitment activity exceeded the year-ago level in 11 of the 13 cities monitored by the Index with Kolkata topping the chart (up 33 percent) followed by Chandigarh (up 29 percent). Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru witnessed a decline, the report said.",

The Monster Employment Index India stood at 292 in March as compared to 261 in the year-ago month. PTI | Apr 11, 2018, 15:22 IST \nNew Delhi, Apr 11 () Online recruitment activity registered 12 per cent increase in March with demand for finance and healthcare professionals witnessing a significant uptrend, says a report. \nThe Monster Employment Index India stood at 292 in March as compared to 261 in the year-ago month. \n\"The economic reforms by the government seem to have started impacting the economy in a positive manner and the online recruitment activity around key sectors such as production and manufacturing can possibly be attributed to it,\" said Abhijeet Mukherjee, CEO, Monster.com- APAC & Gulf. \nThe report noted that finance and accounts, and healthcare professionals saw highest growth year-on-year at 32 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively. \n\"The demand for professionals in finance & accounts can also be a resultant of the massive opportunity created by GST reforms for people with know-how of the new tax regime,\" Mukherjee added. \nHe further said the digital revolution is mirroring the substantial growth across sectors, thereby escalating opportunities and reshaping the fundamental nature of work and iterating the constant need to upskill. \nDuring the reported month, e-recruitment activity exceeded the year-ago level in 11 of the 13 cities monitored by the Index with Kolkata topping the chart (up 33 per cent ) followed by Chandigarh (up 29 per cent. Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru witnessed a decline, the report said. DRR ANU ANU Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App . Download The Times of India news app for your device.

      "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Varo Energy canceled its Amsterdam flotation after seeing how the U.S.-China trade dispute had roiled global markets and negatively affected other European initial public offerings, the company’s chief executive told Reuters on Wednesday.\nVaro announced the cancellation on Tuesday afternoon.\n“After all the optimism earlier in the year, the volatility is being driven by recent discussion around the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies – the U.S. and China – leading to turbulences in the market, which have had an impact on Varo’s planned IPO,” CEO Roger Brown said in an interview.\nThe European downstream company has refineries and storage assets in Western Europe and is owned by oil trading giant Vitol [VITOLV.UL], U.S. private equity firm Carlyle Group ( CG.O ) and Dutch firm Reggeborgh Invest.\nVaro announced its intention to sell 30-40 percent of combined existing shares in March. Banking sources at the time said the firm could be valued at around 2 billion euros ($2.5 billion).\nBrown said the investor presentations in December and February had been successful, but then the market became volatile post-ITF (intention to float).\nThe United States and China have been on the brink of a full-blown trade war since the Trump administration announced in early April a proposed 25 percent tariff on Chinese imports worth about $50 billion. In retaliation, China proposed tariffs on U.S. imports of equal value.\nBut global markets have been on edge since early March, when Washington announced import tariffs on steel and aluminum that took effect on March 23. The move was widely viewed as designed to pressure Beijing to cut excess production capacity.\n“Looking at a number of recent IPOs that did go ahead in Amsterdam, they all listed at the bottom of their ranges and then yesterday they were trading at or below their offer prices,” he said.\nDutch bank NIBC ( NIBC.AS ), energy group Alfen ( ALFEN.AS ) and wholesaler B&S Group ( BSGR.AS ) were among those that were negatively impacted when they started trading in the second half of March on Amsterdam’s bourse Euronext.\nElsewhere in Europe, the stock values of Deutsche Bank unit DWS ( DWSG.DE ) and Sweden’s Bygghema ( BHGF.ST ), which listed at the end of March, also suffered.\nNO RUSH TO LIST Brown said the company would revisit the possibility of a float but there was no timeframe at the moment.\n“We’re not in a hurry to list the company ... We will continue to grow through M&A and organic investments,” Brown said.\n“The IPO was not affecting the company, it was a secondary offering, shareholders were reducing their stake. It would give us further financing options going forward but there’s nothing urgent at the moment that we can’t do.”\nVaro has made nine acquisitions since being set up in 2012 and Brown said last month that more were coming.\nVaro, whose underlying earnings rose to $371 million last year from $328 million in 2016, owns two refineries in Switzerland and Germany, and storage, blending and distribution assets in those two countries, the Benelux nations and France.\nMeanwhile, privately held Vitol said on Tuesday that it intended to list its African venture Vivo Energy. Sources have previously also said the trader was considering a float of its Australian venture Viva Energy.\nAdditional reporting by Toby Sterling in Amsterdam; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ",

Punjab to offer online booking of sand, regulate prices The mining policy of Punjab that’s is being drafted by the cabinet sub-committee proposes introducing online booking system for individuals and panchayats. If approved, the new system — meant to regulate retail prices of sand and based on best practices in 13 states — designated trucks in specific colours and equipped with global positioning system, would soon carry sand from the mines (rivers) to the stockyards. April 11, 2018 0 \nAfter a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee on mining on Tuesday, local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu said, “The contractor’s role will be to carry sand from the mines to the stockyards. With fixing of rates and volumes the state’s revenue will go up. Telangana started with Rs 10 crore in 2014 and today it generates Rs 1,200 crore from the sector. Haryana has only one river and makes Rs 950 crore,” he said. \nThe panel has also made a case for customer feedback system so that the quality, quantity and rates being charged for sand could be cross-checked by way of a third party customer feedback, said Sidhu. \n“Around 65% of the sand consumption is for capital infrastructure by the state but for the last 10 years, there is no record of sand. The excise department keeps track of cement that is used and it can be multiplied with five to estimate how much sand was used without bills,” he said. \n“If today a trolley of sand costs Rs 2,500, the cost can be brought down to Rs 1,000 and this will ensure that volumes go up,” he said. Looking at the need to rein in crushers, it has been suggested that the policy followed by Himachal should be replicated. There is a system of electricity rate at Rs 7 per unit and royalty at Rs 8 per unit. \nIt has been proposed that demand assessment will also be made by designated universities and would include capital infrastructure. The sand mines will be liked with different geographical areas and individuals, local bodies and government departments would be able to order sand online. \nSidhu said till now district survey reports were not prepared and there was no idea where sand was available and in what was its quality. “However, now top institutes like IITs and the Remote Sensing Centre at Ludhiana will be roped in to carry out the exercise,” he said. \nBefore the final report is submitted by the cabinet sub-committee to chief minister Amarinder Singh, the policies of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh too will be studied in the coming days. The panel will submit its report by April 21 to the cabinet. \nAs per the draft, the transporters carrying sand will be registered and there will be specific colour coding for such trucks. To check their movement, GPS and radio frequency ID will be provided. Stockyards will be designated at different locations depending on the demand for sand. \nNo need for new taxes if mining tapped \nNavjot Singh Sidhu said mining was one sector, which, is properly tapped, could rule out the need for imposing new taxes in the state. “Punjab’s revenue from mining has gone up from Rs 40 crore to 130 crore after the Congress took over,” he said. Finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal and Panchayati Raj minister Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa are the other members of the sub-committee. \n‘It’s actually transport mafia’ \nAsked about action against the sand mafia, Sidhu said, “The mining mafia that is talked about is actually transport mafia and the committee will suggest steps to check the menace. This observation has been made by Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu and his state, along with Telangana have the best sand mining systems,” he added. The report is, meanwhile, unlikely to hold anyone individuals responsible for illegal mining. \nInfo- realty.economictimes",

      "text": "Haryana collects stamp duty revenue of over Rs 4,265 crore Revenue and Disaster Management Minister Capt Abhimanyu said that this increase in the revenue is in spite of the slowdown in transactions of immovable property.PTI | April 11, 2018, 14:00 IST\nCHANDIGARH: Haryana government has collected revenue of over Rs 4,265.18 crore as stamp duty and registration fee during the period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 as against Rs 3,260 crore in 2016-17, registering an increase of over Rs 1,005 crore.\nRevenue and Disaster Management Minister Capt Abhimanyu said that this increase in the revenue is in spite of the slowdown in transactions of immovable property.\nAbhimanyu said here today that there has been a record increase in the revenue from stamp duty and registration fee so far in the state.\n\"This has been achieved, despite market stagnation as there has not been commensurate increase in the total number of deeds. The stamp collection in the year 2017-18 is the highest so far in the history of Revenue department,\" he added.\nHe said that this increase in revenue collection could be possible due to regular monitoring and key reforms in land records management and deed registration.\n\"During the last one year, state has carried out a number of reforms with an aim to bring hundred per cent transparency in deed registration, zero tolerance and hassle free services to the citizens,\" the minister said.\nAbhimanyu, who also hold the Finance portfolio, said that new registration system has been implemented in all tehsils and sub-tehsils of the state through E-disha from February 3, 2015, which has resulted not only in saving the time of applicants but also helped in keeping a tab on corruption.\nHe said that under this system, the applicant could get the registry through post within three days. He said the e-stamping system has been implemented in the state with effect from May 2, 2015, which has helped in increasing the revenue and also put a check on corruption. https://realty.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/regulatory/haryana-collects-stamp-duty-revenue-of-over-rs-4265-crore/63706879",

      "text": "News Residential sales up 10% y-o-y in top 7 cities in Q1 2018: Report Homebuyers seem to be showing interest in returning to the market with increasing transparency, accountability and financial discipline in the real estate sector. Residential sales across top seven cities during the quarter ended March have risen 10% from a year ago to 49,200 units, showed data from ANAROCK Property Consultants. April 11, 2018 0 \nProperty markets of Hyderabad and Bengaluru have led the resurgence in sales with 46% and 35% on-year growth in residential sales during the quarter. National Capital Region also witnessed 25% growth, while Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune and Chennai saw 5%, 11%, and 15% decline, respectively. \nOn sequential basis too, housing sales rose 12% from 43,800 units recorded in the quarter ended December. \n“The series of policy reforms and structural changes have transformed the way Indian real estate business is conducted. This has been a definite blessing. The sector is by no means out of the woods yet, but we are now seeing some green shoots of recovery,” said Anuj Puri, Chairman – ANAROCK Property Consultants. \nWith combination of various factors supporting prospective homebuyers, experts have been suggesting that the market is in buyers’ favor. \n“Homebuyers have realized that prices are unlikely to go down much from these levels in most part of the country. This seems to be the right time to buy a house as time correction has already happened and prices have come down in certain parts of the country, interest rates have bottomed out and the government has been encouraging home ownership through both fiscal benefits as well as the (CLSA) subsidy scheme,” said Keki Mistry, Vice Chairman and CEO of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). \nLaunches across these markets stood at 33,300 units, down 18% from a year ago. However, on sequential basis, launches rose 27%, indicating that developers are intent on making up for the lost ground with policy reforms and structural changes now in place. \n“The market has turned end-user friendly and 2018 is bringing new launches that match demand. The days of product mismatch are on their way out,” Puri added. \nKey cities contributing to new launches during the quarter included MMR, Bengaluru and Kolkata, altogether accounting for 66% of addition. Around 6,500 units were launched in Kolkata that saw a massive rise of over 300% December quarter. A large affordable housing project of around 3,500 units was a key contributor to the rise in new units hitting the market in the quarter. \nWhile MMR was a key contributor to new launches in Q1 2018, the city’s new launches recorded a drop of 25% from the previous quarter with 8,600 units. The previously intensely investor-driven city is now finally aligning itself to the changing market conditions with 87% unit additions in the sub-INR 1.5 crore price bracket. \nA notable aspect of new launches was that the share of Tier I developers increased from 35% in the previous quarter to 40% in the current quarter. Evidently, the expected RERA Effect in terms of boosting organized players is making itself felt. \nResidential property prices across these cities remained largely range-bound during the quarter when compared to the previous quarter. The primary reason was the significant unsold stock to the backdrop of limited improvement in demand. Affordable and mid-segment housing dominated, with 74% of unit launches or 24,600 units coming in with price tags under Rs 80 lakh. Supply is now being very visibly geared towards end-users, and this is a major shift from Indian real estate’s previous investor and speculator-driven orientation. \nInfo- realty.economictimes",

      "text": "News HDFC hikes home loan rates by up to 20 basis points HDFC, the country’s largest housing finance company, has increased home loan rates by up to 20 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point). It said the revision follows an increase in the cost of funds from last year. April 11, 2018 0 \nMost of the bank’s customers would be affected only marginally. Interest rates on loans up to Rs 30 lakh have been increased by only 5bps to 8.4% from 8.35% for women borrowers. For others in this category, the rate is 8.45% as against 8.4% earlier. HDFC’s average loan size is around Rs 26 lakh. \nLoans in the Rs 30-75 lakh range are now costlier by 20bps, with loans for women borrowers available at 8.55% and others at 8.6%. There is a similar hike for the Rs 75 lakh-plus category, where women can now avail of loans at 8.65% and others at 8.7%. \nHDFC vice-chairman and CEO Keki Mistry said, “Bond yields are over one percentage point higher from their lowest levels last year. If you compare the yield on 10-year government securities in July with what they are now, it is almost up one per cent.” \nIncidentally, HDFC’s rate hike comes around the same time as the RBI’s softer-than-expected monetary policy. Bond yields have crashed sharply in the new fiscal, raising hopes that the increase in interest rates have been stayed. “Even if we ignore the spike in rates in February and March, they are still higher than last year,” said Mistry. \nUnlike HDFC, which periodically revises interest rates, banks make small incremental changes to their lending rates every month by applying a formula linked to their cost of funds. In March, SBI, ICICI Bank and PNB had hiked their marginal cost of lending rates ( MCLR ). Axis Bank had hiked its MCLR in January and February. \nAlthough competition has increased in the home loan segment, HDFC has managed to maintain its market share. The mortgage company has also among the best home loan portfolio with the lowest level of NPAs at below 1%. One of the reasons for this is that nearly 70% of the bank’s portfolio consist of loans to the salaried class. \nHDFC had recently raised close to Rs 13,500 crore to look at acquisitions and to pursue business opportunities in stressed real estate projects. The company is also looking to acquire a health insurance player. \nInfo- realty.economictimes",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe political affairs committee (PAC) of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) removed Kumar Vishwas as the party in-charge for the Rajasthan Assembly elections, and appointed its national treasurer Deepak Bajpai as his replacement. \n\"Bajpai will be the in-charge of the Assembly elections in Rajasthan. Vishwas was not able to devote time for election preparations due to his preoccupations,\"AAP national spokesperson Ashutosh said on Wednesday. He said the AAP will contest the Assembly polls in Rajasthan — which are due later in 2018 — with full strength. \nHe added that Bajpai will prepare the list of candidates for the polls in the state and it would be finalised by the PAC. \nThe sudden development comes against the backdrop of an internal conflict between Vishwas—a senior leader and party founder—and the party's top leadership. File image of AAP leader Kumar Vishwas. AFP \nRecently, Vishwas refused to follow other AAP leaders embroiled in a defamation suit against Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and tender an apology. \nJaitley filed the case in the Delhi High Court against six AAP leaders: Vishwas, Bajpai, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Raghav Chadha, Ashutosh, and Sanjay Singh. \nWhile Kejriwal began issuing apologies for the remarks made by him against his political opponents in March, Vishwas said he would contest the defamation cases against him. \nHowever, reports of a rift first emerged in June, 2017 when Vishwas skipped an iftaar party organised by the Delhi government. He also stayed away from campaigning in Punjab in 2017, and Rajasthan in January. \nA controversial video further strained the relationship between Kejriwal and Vishwas, who were once close. \"If, in Delhi, you form a government on the anti-corruption plank with the promise of freedom from corruption and fall silent and try to protect your own people when they come under the scanner, you will be questioned by people\", Vishwas said in the video. \nWhile Kejriwal publicly gave Vishwas the thumbs up for the candid talk, a source told Firstpost that privately, the Delhi chief minister was extremely upset. Another source also revealed that when Vishwas continued with his “principled” talks with party workers, Kejriwal purportedly told him: \"I will finish you but I will not turn you into a martyr\". \nIn January, AAP had also denied Vishwas a seat in Parliament. \nWith inputs from agencies Tags : #Aam Aadmi Party #AAP #Arvind Kejriwal #Delhi #Dipak Bajpai #Kumar Vishwas #NewsTracker #Rajasthan Also See",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan row, might also examine a set of myriad family connections linked to a little known company called Credential Finance Ltd, which counted the Videocon Group and seven Kochhar family members as its shareholders. A file photo of ICICI Bank MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar. PTI \nThe agency has registered a preliminary probe in the ICICI-Videocon loan row, naming Deepak Kochhar, Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot and others. But the CBI may want to expand that probe to include Deepak’s wife, ICICI Bank boss Chanda Kochhar, his brother Rajiv and four other Kochhar family members as it seeks to determine alleged wrongdoing in the sanctioning of a Rs 3,250 crore ICICI loan to the Videocon Group. \nThe controversy points to two business deals. Dhoot floated an equal joint venture with Deepak-- NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd. -- and secured loans from ICICI Bank. A few months after the loans were sanctioned, Dhoot transferred ownership to Deepak and exited the clean power venture. \nThe probe could benefit from an examination of records that date back to the early 1990s – Deepak and his brother Rajiv reportedly parted ways in the early 2000s after jointly running Credential Finance, a firm they founded in the 1990s. Credential Finance counted Videocon Group companies and seven members of the Kochhar family as its shareholders, according to a report in the Mint , which cited regulatory filings. \nChanda, Deepak, Rajiv and four other Kochhar family members together held a two percent stake in Credential Finance in 2001. Videocon International Ltd held 17.74 percent and its associate firm Joy Holdings held a 0.8 percent stake. Mahesh Chandra Punglia, a director of NuPower Renewables and a close aide of Dhoot, held 0.8 percent stake, the report added. \nCredential Finance, initially set up as Bloom Field Builders and Construction Co Ltd, last traded on the BSE on 26 December 2001, according to a Moneylife report . \nWith inputs from agencies \nPublished Date: Apr 11, 2018 14:55 PM | Updated Date: Apr 11, 2018 15:12 PM",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) removed Kumar Vishwas as the party in-charge of Rajasthan, CNN-News18 reported on Wednesday. The party's political affairs committee replaced Vishwas with its national treasurer Deepak Bajpai. \nThe sudden development comes against the backdrop of an internal conflict between Vishwas—a senior leader and party founder—and the party's top leadership. File image of AAP leader Kumar Vishwas. AFP \nRecently, Vishwas refused to follow other AAP leaders embroiled in a defamation suit against Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and tender an apology. \nJaitley filed the case in the Delhi High Court against six AAP leaders: Vishwas, Bajpai, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Raghav Chadha, Ashutosh, and Sanjay Singh. \nWhile Kejriwal began issuing apologies for the remarks made by him against his political opponents in March, Vishwas said he would contest the defamation cases against him. \nHowever, reports of a rift first emerged in June, 2017 when Vishwas skipped an iftaar party organised by the Delhi government. He also stayed away from campaigning in Punjab in 2017, and Rajasthan in January. \nA controversial video further strained the relationship between Kejriwal and Vishwas, who were once close. \"If, in Delhi, you form a government on the anti-corruption plank with the promise of freedom from corruption and fall silent and try to protect your own people when they come under the scanner, you will be questioned by people\", Vishwas said in the video. \nWhile Kejriwal publicly gave Vishwas the thumbs up for the candid talk, a source told Firstpost that privately, the Delhi chief minister was extremely upset. Another source also revealed that when Vishwas continued with his “principled” talks with party workers, Kejriwal purportedly told him: \"I will finish you but I will not turn you into a martyr\". \nIn January, AAP also denied Vishwas a seat in Parliament. \nWith inputs from agencies Tags : #Aam Aadmi Party #AAP #Arvind Kejriwal #Delhi #Dipak Bajpai #Kumar Vishwas #NewsTracker #Rajasthan Also See",

      "text": "Apr 2018 , by Admin , in Latest News \nHaryana government has collected revenue of over Rs 4,265.18 crore as stamp duty and registration fee during the period from April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 as against Rs 3,260 crore in 2016-17, registering an increase of over Rs 1,005 crore. \nRevenue and Disaster Management Minister Capt Abhimanyu said that this increase in the revenue is in spite of the slowdown in transactions of immovable property. Abhimanyu said that there has been a record increase in the revenue from stamp duty and registration fee so far in the state. \n“This has been achieved, despite market stagnation as there has not been commensurate increase in the total number of deeds. The stamp collection in the year 2017-18 is the highest so far in the history of Revenue department,” he added. \nHe said that this increase in revenue collection could be possible due to regular monitoring and key reforms in land records management and deed registration. \n“During the last one year, state has carried out a number of reforms with an aim to bring hundred per cent transparency in deed registration, zero tolerance and hassle free services to the citizens,” the minister said. \nAbhimanyu, who also hold the Finance portfolio, said that new registration system has been implemented in all tehsils and sub-tehsils of the state through E-disha from February 3, 2015, which has resulted not only in saving the time of applicants but also helped in keeping a tab on corruption. \nHe said that under this system, the applicant could get the registry through post within three days. He said the e-stamping system has been implemented in the state with effect from May 2, 2015, which has helped in increasing the revenue and also put a check on corruption.",

      "text": "HealthAssure to invest $15 m on global expansion Hyderabad, April 11 \nSRI Capital, owned by serial entrepreneur Sashi Reddi, has invested $1 million into the New Delhi-based healthcare fintech start-up LetsMD. The start-up will use the proceeds to scale up operations across the country. \nLetsMD gives financial access to people for tertiary level healthcare needs. It uses technology to generate loans faster and cater to a wide segment of borrowers who traditionally depend on private sources at exorbitant interest rates. \n“LetsMD has tied up with more than 200 reputed hospitals and super speciality chains like Fortis Healthcare, BLK Hospital and Apollo Hospitals in the Delhi-NCR region so far,” a statement said here on Wednesday. \nExisting Investor Waterbridge Ventures along with Thinkuvate also participated in this round of funding. \n\"With private insurance penetration pegged at less than 10 per cent and healthcare inflation growing at more than 15 per cent, financing Out of Pocket expenses will be healthcare’s most important challenge in the next decade,”the statement said. \n“Moving people from informal and often predatory lending to low, or even zero, interest options is exactly what Indian consumers need,” Sashi Reddi said.

      "text": "\nThe Union Cabinet recently approved the launch of the National Health Protection Mission which was announced during Budget 2018-19. The Mission aims to provide a cover of five lakh rupees per family per year to about 10.7 crore families belonging to poor and vulnerable population. The insurance coverage is targeted for hospitalisation at the secondary and tertiary health care levels. This post explains the healthcare financing scenario in India, which is distributed across the centre, states, and individuals.\nHow much does India spend on health care financing vis-à-vis other countries?\nThe public health expenditure in India (total of centre and state governments) has remained constant at approximately 1.3% of the GDP between 2008 and 2015, and increased marginally to 1.4% in 2016-’17 . This is less than the world average of 6%. Note that the National Health Policy, 2017 proposes to increase this to 2.5% of GDP by 2025.\nIncluding the private sector, the total health expenditure as a percentage of GDP is estimated at 3.9%. Out of the total expenditure, effectively about one-third (30%) is contributed by the public sector. This contribution is low as compared to other developing and developed countries. Examples include Brazil (46%), China (56%), Indonesia (39%), USA (48%), and UK (83%) (see Figure 1).\nWho pays for healthcare in India? Given the public-private split of health care...\nRead more ",

      "text": "9 hours ago ) Seth Meyers brought back his “A Closer Look” segment on Tuesday after using his usual interlude segment on Monday to tell an amazing and heartwarming story of his wife giving birth in the lobby of his apartment building — you should watch that when you get a moment — but Meyers was back in full force with an epic segment last night about Donald Trump ’s whole situation in the wake of the FBI raid of his personal attorney Michael Cohen ’s home and office. “It’s hard to imagine how Donald Trump can be in more legal jeopardy than he is right now. Basically, Trump has more legal problems than Conor McGregor and just as many concussions,” Meyers joked. ” And yet somehow things got much worse yesterday for Trump.” Meyers then dove through the many levels of madness involved in the Cohen raid. *Also Read:* Kimmel on FBI Raid of Trump's Attorney: 'It's Never a Great Sign When Your Lawyer Needs a Lawyer' (Video) “Just to recap: the FBI, an organization Trump has attacked for months, raided the office of Michael Cohen, his long time personal fixer, and seized tax documents, which he has repeatedly refused to release, related to campaign finance violations during the election involving Stormy Daniels , the porn star he allegedly had an affair with, on a referral from Robert Mueller , the special counsel in the Russia investigation,” Meyers said breathlessly. “This is like the series finale of a TV show where they try to tie all the different plot lines together. ‘Oh, it’s Michael Cohen from season 1, what’s he doing in this episo– oh!’ If Trump ever goes on trial, they’re going to call characters from previous episodes into the courtroom like the last episode of ‘Seinfeld. ‘Oh, no, Anthony Scaramucci, what did I do to you?’ ‘No Mooch for you!’ Meyers then wryly described Trump’s angry Twitter response to everything going on Tuesday morning. *Also Read:* Stephen Colbert Offers Michael Cohen Some Advice: 'I'm Sure the FBI Will Keep This Whole Thing Quiet for $130,000' (Video) “Of course when news like this breaks we can always count on our calm, rational president to react in a measured way and he once again rose to the occasion this morning when he got up bright and early and tweeted these reassuring words to a nation in turmoil: ‘Attorney-client privilege is dead!’ And then less than a minute later he added this helpful follow up, ‘A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!'” Meyers said. “So the feds seized Trump’s communications with his lawyers and the next morning Trump woke up and screamed “Attorney-client privilege is dead!” What is Trump’s strategy here? To act so guilty the feds will think he has to be innocent? You know, the insanity defense only works after you’ve been arrested, right? ‘they can’t arrest me if I’m crazy. Quick, somebody get me a diaper I can wear as a hat.” You can watch all of the “A Closer Look” segment from Tuesday’s “Late Night with Seth Meyers” in the video embedded at the top of this post. *Related stories from TheWrap:* Kimmel on FBI Raid of Trump's Attorney: 'It's Never a Great Sign When Your Lawyer Needs a Lawyer' (Video) 'SNL': Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump Proves He Can Read, Admits He Doesn't Care About America (Video) Seth Meyers: Trump Is 'Rearranging Deck Chairs on the Titanic After It Already Sunk' (Video)",

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Published: April 11, 2018 1:57:36 pm Trade industry and transporters located in these states may obtain registration/enrollment on e-way bill portal. (File) Related News Govt is on course to achieve fiscal deficit target of 3.5 per cent, says Hasmukh Adhia \nWith a smooth run of electronic way bill system for inter-state movement of goods and services tax regime for sales worth over Rs 50,000 since April 1, the government is set to rollout its intra-state movement from April 15. The five states which would form part of the first phase are Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh while Karnataka is the only state which had rolled out e-way bill system for intra-state movement of goods from April 1. \n“With the rollout of e-way bill system in these states, it is expected that trade and industry will be further facilitated insofar as the transport of goods is concerned, thereby eventually paving the way for a nation-wide single e-way bill system,” the ministry said in a quote to PTI. \nCEO Prakash Kumar had earlier told the Indian Express that they are ” fully prepared” for the intra-state e-way bill system and the underlying IT software has been augmented to handle 75 lakh e-way bills generation per day. \nTouted as an anti-evasion measure, the GST council, last month, had decided on a staggered rollout of the e-way bill starting with inter-state from April 1 and intra-state from April 15. So far, nine lakh inter-state e-way bills are being generated per day and in total, 52.5 lakh e-way bills have been generated in the first seven days of April. \nA day before the nationwide launch of e-way bill system for inter-state movement of goods, the finance ministry said that the validity of an e-way bill will be counted from the day a transporter fills in the details in the GST form for the first time. As per the e-way bill system, businesses and transporters need to generate an e-way bill for moving goods worth over Rs 50,000 from one state to another. \nThe government has said that implementation of e-way bills will improve direct and indirect collections by clamping down on trade that currently happens on cash basis. The e-way bill system had collapsed when it was first introduced in February for trials forcing the government to put on hold after the system developed glitches in generating permits. \nBut the platform was later made more robust. Finance secretary Hasmukh Adhia had said, “people will take some time to adjust to the system and over a period the authorities will start checking the trucks, adding that there is penalty provision for those who do not generate the bills.” \nThe implementation of the nationwide e-way bill mechanism under GST regime is being done by GSTN in association with the National Informatics Centre and is being run on portal- http://ewaybillgst.gov.in/ .

      "text": "Online GST Certification Course- Lat 3 days to Register Telangana State Seed Certification Agency Vs. CIT (Exemptions) (ITAT Hyderabad) Hon’ble High Court has held that the assessee is rendering services in relation to trade commerce or business and since its income exceeded Rs. 25.00 lakhs, it cannot be treated as a charitable institution. This decision of the Hon’ble High Court is dated 17.12.2012. We find that there are amendments to section 2(15) subsequent to this date. Vide Finance Act of 2015 w.e.f. 1.4.2016, the cut off benchmark has been changed to 20% of the total receipts instead of the fixed limit of Rs. 25.00 lakhs as it existed earlier. Further, we also observe that vide Finance Act of 2012, a new sub-section 8 has been inserted u/s 13 to provide that such organization would not get the benefit of tax exemption in the particular year in which its receipts from the commerce activities exceeds the threshold limit whether or not the registration granted is cancelled and the amendment has been made retrospectively from 1.4.2009 and therefore, it applies to A.Ys 2009-10 on wards. The CBDT has also clarified that in view of this position, it shall not be mandatory, for the registration granted u/s 12AA of the Act to a charitable institution, to be cancelled merely on the ground that the cut off specified in the proviso to section 2(15) of the Act is exceeded in a particular year without there being any change in the nature of the activities of the institution and that, if in any particular year, the specified limit exceeds, the tax exemption would be denied to the institution in that year and cancellation of the registration would not be mandatory unless such cancellation become necessary on the ground(s) prescribed under the Act. Thus, it can be seen that the assessee is carrying on activity for advancement of any other object or general public utility, falling within the definition of “charitable purpose” as defined u/s 2(15) of the Act and may be eligible for exemption u/s 2(15) of the Act, in a year where it does not cross the cut-off percentage and may not be eligible for exemption in the year, in which it crosses the cut-off mark. Therefore, it cannot be made to seek registration u/s 12AA of the Act in each of the year where it shall become eligible to claim exemption. The Hon’ble High Court was considering the application u/s 10(23)(C) of the Act which would ultimately take the assessee out of the tax ambit, unless it violates the terms & conditions of such exemption. The CIT (E) is supposed to consider the aims and objects of the society for grant of registration u/s 12AA of the Act. The Hon’ble High Court has held that the assessee’s activities falls under the activity of advancement of any general public utility and we are of the opinion that the registration u/s 12AA of the Act should be considered on its own merits. If the assessee is carrying on or is rendering any services with respect to any trade, commerce or business and crosses the threshold limit provided u/s 2(15) of the Act, then its income shall not be exempt from tax u/s 11 of the Act in the relevant A.Y. Therefore, we direct the CIT (E) to consider the aims and objects of the society and grant registration u/s 12AA of the Act if the assessee’s activities falls under the definition of charitable purpose u/s 2(15) of the Act without reference to the proviso there under. Therefore, assessee’s appeal is treated as allowed for statistical purposes. \nRELEVANT EXTRACT OF ITAT JUDGMENT This is assessee’s appeal against the order of the Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions), dated 29.04.20 16 rejecting the assessee’s application for grant of registration u/s 12AA of the Act. 2. Brief facts of the case are that the assessee is a society registered as the A.P. State Seed Certification Agency. It filed an application for registration u/s 1 2AA of the Act by filing form No. 10A on 30.10.2015 along with (i) the certified copy of the instrument under which the Trust was established; (ii) list of Trustees; (iii) copy of PAN; and (iv) a brief note on activities of the organization. The CIT (E) required the assessee to produce the original Trust Deed/MOU for verification and to furnish detailed reply on specific points. Though the learned representative of the assessee appeared from time to time, he failed to file the required details. On going through the information already filed by the Society, the CIT (E) observed that the Hon’ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh has held that the objects of A.P. State Seed Certification Agency are not for “advancement of any other object of general public utility” and hence not for ‘charitable purposes’ and dismissed the writ filed by the A.P. State Seed Certification Agency. Observing that the said case law is squarely applicable to the assessee society, he rejected the assessee’s application, against which, the assessee is in appeal before us. 3. The learned Counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee has been formed after the formation of the State of Telangana, but the aims and objects of the assessee society are the same as in the case of A.P. State Seed Certification Agency. He submitted that the issue before the Hon’ble A.P. High Court is different from the issue of registration u/s 12AA of the Act before the CIT (E). Therefore, according to him, the CIT(E) ought not to have relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble High Court to deny the registration. He submitted that in the case of A.P. State Seed Certification Agency, the issue before the Hon’ble High Court was the registration u/s 10(23)C(iv) of the Act and the Hon’ble High Court, after considering the amended proviso to section 2(15) of the Act, observed that the assessee was engaged in the activity of trade/business/commerce and that its income was more than Rs.25.00 lakhs for the relevant A.Ys, has denied the registration u/s 10(23)(C)(iv) of the Act, whereas according to him, the Hon’ble High Court has agreed that the activities carried on by the assessee were towards the advancement of general public utility. He submitted that vide registration u/s 10(23)(C) of the Act, the income of the assessee would go entirely out of the tax ambit whereas the registration u/s 12A would only enable the assessee to claim the deduction u/s 11 of the Act which is again subject to verification by the AO year after year. Therefore, according to him, both the sections are independent and stand part and the decision of the Hon’ble High Court with respect to allowability of section 10(23)(C) cannot be applied to a case of rejection of registration u/s 12AA of the Act. He has also drawn our attention to the main objects of the assessee society to demonstrate that the seed certification is for the purpose of the benefit of the farmers of the State and therefore, the work involves “advancement of general public utility”. He submitted that section 2(15) has since undergone an amendment, whereby the cut off bench mark has been fixed at 20% of the total receipts instead of the fixed limit of Rs.25.00 lakhs w.e.f. 1.4.20 16. He referred to the circular of CBDT dated 27.05.20 16 which clarified that it shall not be mandatory to cancel the registration already granted u/s 12AA to a charitable institution, merely because the cut off specified in the provisions of section 2(15), is exceeded in a particular year without there being any change in the nature of the activities of the institution and that if in any particular year, the specified cut off is exceeded, the tax exemption would be denied to the Institution in that year and cancellation of registration would not be mandatory unless such cancellation becomes necessary on the ground(s) prescribed under the Act. Thus, he submitted that the eligibility of the assessee to claim exemption u/s 11 of the Act is to be verified by the AO every year, even though the registration is granted u/s 12A of the Act unlike the registration granted u/s 10(23)(C) of the Act under which the exemptions shall be allowed till such registration is revoked. Thus, he prayed that the assessee should be granted registration u/s 1 2AA of the Act. He has also placed reliance upon the various case law to the effect that section 12A registration shall not be cancelled in view of the applicability of the amended proviso to section 2(15) of the I.T. Act. 4. The learned DR, on the other hand, supported the orders of the CIT (E) and also placed reliance upon the decision of the Hon’ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh in the case of A.P. State Seed Certification Agency referred to by the CIT (E). 5. Having regard to the rival contentions and the material on record, we find that the assessee earlier known as A.P. State Seed Certification Agency, on formation of the State of Telangana in the year 2014, had been formed as Telangana State Seed certification Agency and submitted an application for registration u/s 12AA of the Act in Form No. 10A. We find that the CIT (E), without verifying the aims and objects of the assessee society, has rejected the same by following the decision of the Hon’ble A.P. High Court in the case of A.P. State Seed Certification Agency vs. Chief Commissioner of Income Tax & Others, reported in (2013) 356 ITR 0360 (A.P). We have gone through the decision of the Hon’ble High Court and we find that the grievance of the assessee therein was against the rejection of the assessee’s application for approval u/s 10(23)(C) of the Act. While considering the assessee’s application for renewal of registration u/s 10(23)(C)(iv) of the Act for the A.Y 2010-11, the Hon’ble High Court has also considered the audited accounts of the assessee for the financial year 2009-10 relevant for the A.Y 2010-11 and observed that the assessee is carrying on the activity of rendering the service in relation to any trade, commerce of business under the provisions of section 2(15) of the Act and therefore, such an activity falls within the “advancement of any other object or general public utility” included in the terms charitable purpose as defined in section 2(15) of the Act. The Hon’ble High Court held that, in view of the fact that the certification of the seed by the petitioners facilitates trade, commerce or business in the certifying the seeds of the clients of the petitioner, the proviso to sub-section would come into operation and therefore, its activities cannot be held to be for charitable purposes and therefore, upheld the rejection of the petitioner’s appeal for renewal of registration u/s 10(23(C)(iv) of the Act. The relevant portion of the decision is reproduced here under for ready reference: “17. Section 8 of the Seeds Act, 1966 empowers the State Government or the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to establish, by notification in the official gazette, a certification agency for the State to carry out the functions entrusted to the certification agency by or under the Seeds Act. The petitioner was registered under the Andhra Pradesh (Telangana Area) Public Societies Registration Act, 1350 Fasli with registration No. 334/76. By G.O.Ms.No.435 Food and Agriculture (EP- II) Department dated 01-06- 1977, the State Government approved the proposal of the Director of Agriculture and directed that the petitioner shall carry on the functions of the certification agency under the Seeds Act, 1966 in the Andhra Pradesh State with effect from 01-06-1977. The objects of the petitioner have already been set out above. The petitioner thus certifies the Seeds which meet the minimum seeds certification standards as per Indian Minimum Seed Certification Standards, 1988. Seed growers enter into contract with a society/agent, who approaches the petitioner for certification of the seeds and after securing certification, they sell the certified seeds to the farmers at a market price determined by them. The petitioner collects a fee for providing certification as the process of certification involves technical and scientific evaluation of the seeds although the fee collected by it would be enough to enable it to sustain its activities and may not result in much profit. The term “advancement of any other object of general public utility” used in Section 2 (15) of the Act includes all objects to promote the welfare of the public particularly when the object is to promote or protect the interest of a particular trade or industry. The activity of the petitioner which facilitates sale of certified seeds to farmers therefore falls within “advancement of any other object of general public utility” included in the definition of the term “charitable purpose” as defined in Section 2 (15) of the Act but in view of the fact that certification of seeds by the petitioner facilitates trade, commerce or business in the certified seeds by the client of the petitioner, the proviso to the said section would come into operation. Thus the petitioner’s activity assists the sale of certified seeds and is “in relation to any trade, commerce or business” and therefore its activity cannot be held to be a “charitable purpose”. In this view of the matter, we hold that the 1st respondent rightly rejected the application of the petitioner for approval under Section 10 (23C) (iv) of the Act”. 6. We thus, find that the Hon’ble High Court has held that the assessee is rendering services in relation to trade commerce or business and since its income exceeded Rs. 25.00 lakhs, it cannot be treated as a charitable institution. This decision of the Hon’ble High Court is dated 17.12.2012. We find that there are amendments to section 2(15) subsequent to this date. Vide Finance Act of 2015 w.e.f. 1.4.2016, the cut off benchmark has been changed to 20% of the total receipts instead of the fixed limit of Rs. 25.00 lakhs as it existed earlier. Further, we also observe that vide Finance Act of 2012, a new sub-section 8 has been inserted u/s 13 to provide that such organization would not get the benefit of tax exemption in the particular year in which its receipts from the commerce activities exceeds the threshold limit whether or not the registration granted is cancelled and the amendment has been made retrospectively from 1.4.2009 and therefore, it applies to A.Ys 2009-10 on wards. The CBDT has also clarified that in view of this position, it shall not be mandatory, for the registration granted u/s 12AA of the Act to a charitable institution, to be cancelled merely on the ground that the cut off specified in the proviso to section 2(15) of the Act is exceeded in a particular year without there being any change in the nature of the activities of the institution and that, if in any particular year, the specified limit exceeds, the tax exemption would be denied to the institution in that year and cancellation of the registration would not be mandatory unless such cancellation become necessary on the ground(s) prescribed under the Act. Thus, it can be seen that the assessee is carrying on activity for advancement of any other object or general public utility, falling within the definition of “charitable purpose” as defined u/s 2(15) of the Act and may be eligible for exemption u/s 2(15) of the Act, in a year where it does not cross the cut-off percentage and may not be eligible for exemption in the year, in which it crosses the cut-off mark. Therefore, it cannot be made to seek registration u/s 12AA of the Act in each of the year where it shall become eligible to claim exemption. The Hon’ble High Court was considering the application u/s 10(23)(C) of the Act which would ultimately take the assessee out of the tax ambit, unless it violates the terms & conditions of such exemption. 7. The CIT (E) is supposed to consider the aims and objects of the society for grant of registration u/s 12AA of the Act. The Hon’ble High Court has held that the assessee’s activities falls under the activity of advancement of any general public utility and we are of the opinion that the registration u/s 12AA of the Act should be considered on its own merits. If the assessee is carrying on or is rendering any services with respect to any trade, commerce or business and crosses the threshold limit provided u/s 2(15) of the Act, then its income shall not be exempt from tax u/s 11 of the Act in the relevant A.Y. Therefore, we direct the CIT (E) to consider the aims and objects of the society and grant registration u/s 12AA of the Act if the assessee’s activities falls under the definition of charitable purpose u/s 2(15) of the Act without reference to the proviso there under. Therefore, assessee’s appeal is treated as allowed for statistical purposes. 8. In the result, assessee’s appeal is treated as allowed for statistical purposes. Order pronounced in the Open Court on 25 th January, 2018.",
