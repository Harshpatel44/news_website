      "text": "IPL 2018 Live Score Cricket, RR vs DD: Stokes Taking the Attack to Delhi Bowlers Cricketnext Staff |   8:17 PM IST Match 6, Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur 11 April, 2018 Live Now : Toss won by Delhi Daredevils (decided to bowl) TOSS NEWS: Gautam Gambhir wins the toss and Delhi will bowl first as Gambhir feels that the pitch will remain the same and there could be dew later in the evening. Rahane says toss is not in one's hand and he is happy to bat first. Same team for RR and Nadeem comes in for Mishra for DD. Maxwell comes in for Christian. 20:15(IST) \nChris Morris has now come into the attack in place of Nadeem as Delhi look to further dent the Rajasthan line-up. One wicket here for Delhi and the pressure will be on Rajasthan who hasn't got off to a good start whatsoever. Rahane and Stokes are trying to build a good partnership here. 20:13(IST) \nAnother good over from Boult as he gives away just five runs from it. Yes, there was boundary from it but other than than, there was just one single and other deliveries were dot balls. Gambhir will be happy how his bowlers have bowled thus far in the innings. 20:11(IST) \nFour: Ben Stokes has come out early and he has made his intentions clear by hitting Boult for a stunning boundary. Stokes came dancing down the track and hit the ball through the covers for a boundary. Good start for the southpaw. 20:08(IST) \nOUT: Short hit the first Nadeem delivery for a boundary, but then on the next ball he is dismissed, courtesy of a stunning peice of fielding by Vijay Shankar. After hitting the ball on the on side, the batsmen went for a double, but Shankar hit the stumps directly and afffected the run out. First blood to Delhi. 20:05(IST) \nExcellent first over from Boult to start the proceedings as he gives away just just 6 runs from it and doesn't concede a single boundary. Shahbaz Nadeem comes onto bowl now. He has come into the side in place of Amit Mishra who was taken for runs in the previous game against SRH. 20:01(IST) \nRahane and Short have made their way into the middle and Trent Boult is bowling the first over of the match. Rahane gets off the mark with a double and the onus will be on these two to score some runs early on. 19:56(IST) \nThe onus will be on Rajasthan openers Rahane and Short to provide their team with an ideal start. But at this ground, out of four matches Rajasthan has won three matches and therefore enjoy a much better head to head record. With so many batting powerhouses in their ranks, Rajasthan will look to start with a bang in front of their home ground. 19:46(IST) \nDew factor has forced Gambhir to bowl first and Rahane agreed to it during the toss. Even Rajasthan wanted to bowl first due to the dew factor which will make it difficult for bowling in the later stages of the match. 19:41(IST) \nBoth team lost their respective opening matches and will look to get back to winning ways in this clash. While Delhi will look to Glenn Maxwell, who returns after missing the first match due to personal reasons. As for Rajasthan, they are playing the same squad as last time and will look at their big money signings to fire. 19:36(IST) \nTeams: Rajasthan Royals (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane(c), D Arcy Short, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Jos Buttler(w), Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin Delhi Daredevils (Playing XI): Colin Munro, Gautam Gambhir(c), Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh Pant(w), Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Shahbaz Nadeem, Trent Boult, Mohammed Shami 19:35(IST) \nAt the TOSS, Gambhir: Looks a good wicket, won't change much. Perhaps dew will come in. That's why we are chasing. Just the start of the tournament, need to get the combination right. We have the full squad now. Maxi is back and we all know how dangerous he can be. Important to get the combinations right and hopefully we can do it. Two changes - Nadeem for Mishra, Maxwell for Christian. Rahane: We would have bowled as well but as I said, toss isn't in our control. We will look to bat well and put runs on the board. I think the boys have adjusted to the conditions well, especially the overseas ones. They are experienced campaigners. We are unchanged. \n19:32(IST) \nTOSS NEWS: Gautam Gambhir wins the toss and Delhi will bowl first as Gambhir feels that the pitch will remain the same and there could be dew later in the evening. Rahane says toss is not in one's hand and he is happy to bat first. Same team for RR and Nadeem comes in for Mishra for DD. Maxwell comes in for Christian. 19:25(IST) \nBanned for life from cricket activities, former Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra on Friday said he has filed a petition in the Supreme Court after Delhi Police gave him a clean chit in the Indian Premier League betting scandal. Kundra had filed an application under Right To Information at the Delhi Police who in their reply said there's \"no evidence\" of betting charges against him. \"We have filed an application under RTI to Delhi police seeking whether there's any evidence against me on the alleged betting,\" Kundra told reporters on the sidelines of an Indian Chambers of Commerce programme. \"The answer we got against the RTI is that they have no evidence against me, and I have nothing to do with betting. The RTI is available to all of you. Even you can file an RTI and see it.\" Kundra and then ICC chief N Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan were suspended from any type of cricket matches for life after they were found guilty of betting in the T20 tournament. The Supreme Court-appointed committee in its 2015 verdict had also suspended former champions Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals for two years. The two franchises will be back this season after serving two years suspensions and Kundra hoped the ban is overturned and he is back to resume duties at the Rajasthan Royals. \"I hope so (the ban is overturned). We have submitted it and I don't know the date of a hearing. It's in the courts. We all have trust in the judicial systems. Fingers crossed. In our review (petition) we have asked please see what the Delhi Police has said and the basis on which I've been banned for life. Please study the new evidence, study them and tell us if I committed any crime. Then I will accept it. If Delhi Police is clearly saying I've done 'nothing wrong, why penalise me', why I'm being victimised.\" 19:20(IST) \nNepal's cricket sensation Sandeep Lamichhane on Saturday urged the game's administrators to increase the number of teams in the World Cup and give associate nations a better chance of playing on the sport's biggest stage. Lamichhane, 17, and his teammates made history earlier this month when Nepal gained one-day international status at the World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe. The 2019 World Cup in England and Wales will have 10 teams -- including the West Indies and Afghanistan, who won their spots in tournament through the qualifiers. Lamichhane -- the first Nepalese player to land an Indian Premier League deal -- believes the International Cricket Council should give more opportunities to up-and-coming teams. \"Every player from every country dreams of playing (in) the World Cup,\" the leg-spinner told reporters in New Delhi on Saturday. \"ICC should have increased the number of teams so that every player gets a chance to play (in) the World Cup and grow their cricket to the top level.\" He has come a long way from competing against players from associate nations to playing with some of cricket's biggest stars in India's cash-rich Twenty20 tournament. The IPL's Delhi Daredevils paid $318,000 to sign him in January. Now Lamichhane, who has been likened to spin legend Shane Warne, is being coached by World Cup-winning former Australia captain Ricky Ponting. \"He is a fantastic player from his era to now and it's a precious moment to share a dressing room with him,\" Lamichhane said of the batting great. The Nepalese teenager also trained at Michael Clarke's cricket academy in Sydney after he was spotted by the former Australian skipper at the Hong Kong T20 Blitz tournament in 2016. The same year, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) was suspended by the ICC because of political interference by the Himalayan nation's government. Lamichhane is hopeful that his IPL stint will be the start of a new era for Nepal's cricketers. \"We were nowhere in cricket in the last two years (but) after getting ODI status recently we are getting lots of opportunities,\" he said. \"I think (the IPL) is a great opportunity for me and it will help grow our cricket back home. We want to remain... an ODI nation and we want to play Test cricket as well.\" Lamichhane added that exposure at the game's highest level will help bridge the gap between players from associate nations and cricket's powerhouses. At Delhi, he will be joined by Australian allrounder Glenn Maxwell, New Zealand pacemen Trent Boult and South Africa's Kagiso Rabada. \"Some of the balls which can't be hit by associate players, (top players) can smash them anywhere,\" Lamichhane said. The \"difference is experience, we don't get to play those big games. We don't get that kind of exposure.\" 19:14(IST) \nThe BCCI is all set to monitor workload of top 50 Indian cricketers, starting with the seven-week IPL, and will create a database for their workload and injury management to keep them fresh for big international assignments. It has been learnt that the Indian team management is keen that a big pool of players including the top internationals, fringe players and domestic performers are brought under a robust performance and fitness monitoring system in the coming years. \"Yes, the plan is there on the anvil. We want to create a database of 50 players. In those 50 players, 27 are our centrally contracted players (with Mohammed Shami re-inducted) and there will be another 23 players, who will be added to the list. These 23 players will be short-listed during the Indian Premier League,\" a senior BCCI office-bearer said. \"Starting from India's tour of UK (which includes a short tour of Ireland), the national team is going to have enormous amount of workload till 2019 World Cup in England. Those who are performing, will have their workload monitored as well as the various parameters of their fitness levels checked. If they don't attain required levels, they are not likely to be considered for India or India ‘A’ teams. Physio Patrick Farhart will monitor them at the National Cricket Academy (NCA),\" the official added. The blue-print is being prepared and the national selection committee headed by MSK Prasad will have a major role in selecting the 23 players. The BCCI earlier had also put plans in place to monitor the workload of fast bowlers during the IPL with a cap on the number of overs that each centrally contracted player would send down at the nets. With big tours of England and Australia coming up in the next nine months and the volume of ODI cricket set to increase, BCCI will need at least 7-8 fit fast bowlers, who could be rotated and kept fresh. Apart from the 27 in the list, it is expected that players such as Rishabh Pant, Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, Avesh Khan and Deepak Hooda are likely to be inducted. 19:07(IST) \nHaving recently taken over the captaincy at Rajasthan Royals from Steve Smith in the wake of the ball-tampering controversy that has rocked Australian cricket, Ajinkya Rahane believes it is important to respect the Aussie batsman’s record. Smith along with David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were banned by Cricket Australia for their roles in the ball-tampering incident in Cape Town. Smith and Bancroft incidentally were the two players who admitted to this incident after the third day’s play in the third Test against South Africa. “Whatever had to happen has happened. It’s bygone now. It is not for me to comment on the amount of penalty handed to him by the Cricket Australia and the ICC. But his cricketing record should be respected. I respect him as a batsman and player,” Rahane said during a media conference. Along with Smith, his teammate David Warner also lost his captaincy with the IPL side Sunrisers Hyderabad in the aftermath of the controversy in South Africa. The absence of both the Australian batsman means there is added responsibility for the other players according to Rahane, more so on him as the captain of the Royals. “Yes we would miss him but we have a replacement Heinrich Klaasen. I feel it is an added responsibility and also a big challenge for me,” said Rahane. Smith, Warner and Bancroft were all sent home from the South Africa series by Cricket Australia after a probe. All three players, on arrival addressed the local media in emotional press conferences and apologised for their actions. 18:59(IST) \nIt was last year that the BCCI had made it mandatory for its players to clear the yo-yo endurance test. This is a general parameter to rate the fitness of cricketers worldwide. Now with the IPL starting in a few days, some of the franchises are also making its players take the test. According to reports, four out of the eight franchises have already made their players undergo the yo-yo test in the lead-up to the event. Mumbai Indians conducted their yo-yo tests at a ground in the outskirts of Mumbai whereas other franchises who too have made it mandatory for their players to take the test are Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals. It is also learnt that Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Daredevils and Chennai Super Kings are yet to adopt the endurance test in their training schedules. Mumbai players were given 14.5 seconds to complete each level of the yo-yo test, starting from level 5. At RCB, players had to undergo the test as soon as they were picked in the auction, just to get their lung power tested. The reason for this is, so that the teams can design the training programmes accordingly. “The teams now want their players to match up to the standards adopted by international teams around the world. India now has made the yo-yo test mandatory, so it’s natural to see some of the IPL teams follow suit. It’s good to see where each player stands in terms of their fitness levels how much work the support staff needs to put in behind the scenes with them,” said one member of an IPL team. 18:48(IST) \nIndia batsman Shreyas Iyer feels the great Ricky Ponting's \"go for the kill\" approach can help Delhi Daredevils immensely in their quest for a maiden IPL trophy. It has been just four days since head coach Ponting joined the Daredevils and the young Indian players seemed to be in awe of the two-time World Cup winning Australia captain. Daredevils is a team that has under-performed consistently and the franchise is banking on Ponting to change the trend. The 43-year-old had earlier coached Mumbai Indians to an IPL title in 2015 and was with the team for two years. Iyer revealed how Ponting fired up the squad with his opening speech. \"It has been really good with (Ponting so far). He has been pretty aggressive. He has got that positive frame of mind. When he came in and gave a speech to all of us, it really fired us, we almost had goose bumps,\" said Iyer, who was one of the three players retained by the team ahead of the auction. The Gautam Gambhir-led squad has a good mix of experience and youth including U-19 stars Prithivi Shaw and Abhishek Sharma. \"We have a lot of youngsters in the team and they like freedom. Suddenly he came in and made us feel free,\" said Iyer. Ponting's speech pretty much focussed on winning the tournament, added Iyer. \"He said that 'we are here to win'. His frame of mind was pretty much about winning, not about the process. Normally, everybody comes in and talks a lot about process and but this guy had just one thing in his mind and that was to win,\" said the Mumbai batsman. Asked whether he brings in the typical Australian aggression with him, Iyer said: \"We can say that way. When I say aggression, he gives us freedom as well. He has asked us to play our own game. He has got his own way of preparing every youngster and though it has been just three days, we all know that we will get to learn a lot from him,\" he said. 18:40(IST) \nOn January 27, Rahul Tripathi's life changed forever. Despite having a base prize of Rs 20 Lakh, the Pune resident fetched a whopping Rs 3.4 Crores from Rajasthan Royals in the IPL auction in Bengaluru. But the 27 year old is determined not to let the recent success get to his head. \"I think the money is being taken care of by my dad. I am just happy to play as playing cricket is more important for me now,\" says Tripathi. Describing the scenes at his house on the auction day, he says: \"Yes, my parents were tracking the auction. They were happy that their son has gone to a good team. But they were like: 'Humare bete ka kya hoga, kaunse team me jayega' but eventually, they were very happy the way the auction panned out for me.​\" Last year, when Rising Pune Supergiant made the final of the IPL, Tripathi played his part to the perfection, scoring 391 runs at an impressive strike rate of 146. Numbers show hitting comes naturally to Tripathi. He had even slammed six sixes in an over in a domestic tournament, not once but twice! However, Tripathi says he had no \"particular strategy\" for slogging. \"​No particular strategy, I just prepared myself to play according to the ball. Didn't think much like 'I need to do this or that.' I just practised hard and knew what shot I wanted to play. I just concentrated on the ball better and how the ball will come onto the bat. That's it,\" said Tripathi. Tripathi had humble beginnings. The amount of money received at such a young age can affect any youngsters. But not Tripathi who is more than happy to get an opportunity to showcase his talent on a big stage. \"IPL is a great opportunity for youngsters like us to go out and play some of the finest bowlers in international cricket. I just wanted to repeat the way I played last year. So the money wasn't a big factor for me. For me, it was an opportunity to play at such a big stage and get recognised for it,\" he asserts. Like any other budding cricketer Tripathi too dreams of playing for India someday. But he knows, with the likes of KL Rahul already waiting in the wings, breaking into the current Indian team as an opener is not going to be easy. \"Yes, I am going to work hard this time. And definitely if I keep performing well, then who knows I will soon get the opportunity to represent my country,\" Tripathi added. It was Steve Smith who was his captain when he played his first game in IPL for Pune last year. When asked about the recent ball-tampering incident which has tarnished the image of former Australia captain, Tripathi refuses to opine his views. \"It's an unfortunate incident and that's all I can say about it,\" he signed-off. 18:36(IST) \nRajasthan Royals mentor Shane Warne has put his weight behind skipper Ajinkya Rahane and said that he fully believe in the capabilities of the star India batsman. \"I am happy to be back with the Rajasthan Royals and I am grateful for the great opportunity given to me. It's like coming back to home. The best squad is put together and we have the best captain in Ajinkya Rahane whom I fully trust,\" he said. \"We have few match winners with bat and the ball as well. We have great talent at our disposal and it was wonderful job done at the auction.\" Skipper Rahane said that it was another opportunity for him to learn from Warne. \"We have a great side and I am really excited for the coming season. I am looking to learn some more things from Shane Warne,\" said Rahane. Talking about the DRS system introduced for the first time in IPL, Rahane said that it would be helpful. \"DRS is being introduced for the first time in IPL and it would be helpful. I am excited regarding it but the only thing is that I will have to trust the wicket keeper and the bowler before making an appeal,\" he said. \"I feel Sanju Samson who would be keeping the wickets will have to be more watchful.\" Meanwhile, Warne also lashed out at opportunists and said that the ball tampering scandal has given a chance to the cricketing world to \"slam boot\" into Australians. He also felt that every country should take this opportunity to look into their own back yards and decide how they want to play the game. Warne, who has taken over the role of a Mentor for Rajasthan Royals, said he was disappointed and embarrassed by what happened during the third Test between Australia and South Africa in Cape Town. \"It is very disappointing but I feel that this given an opportunity to others to slam boot into Australians without any reason,\" Warner said. \"I am not defending what Smith has done and I am also embarrassed as any other Australians with the happenings. Anyone who has been beaten by Australia, who don't like the way the Australians play the game or they don't like any individual in any country have taken the opportunity to take boots into the Australians.” Warne, who had also led Rajasthan Royals to the title in the inaugural edition of the IPL in 2008, said every nation should introspect and decide how they want to play the sport. \"I think it is great opportunity for every single country look into its own backyards and think the way they want to play cricket and for what we stand for including the Australians. Otherwise this opportunity would go,\" said Warne who was the skipper of Rajasthan Royals for four seasons. 18:27(IST) \nDelhi Daredevils have been one of the most underachieving IPL sides over the past few years, finishing in the bottom-half of the table in the last three seasons. This year, Daredevils have turned to local city boy Gautam Gambhir, who they let go in 2011 and he joined Kolkata Knight Riders, helping them win two titles under his captaincy. Gautam Gambhir last played for DD in IPL 2010. He has scored 1097 out of his 4132 IPL runs (26.55%) with Delhi. He is one of two skippers to have captained more than 100+ IPL games. Gambhir has led his team 123 times, while Dhoni has led his 143 times. 60%: Gambhir’s win rate as skipper of DD (9 wins in 15 matches): the best by any player to have skippered the franchise 10 or more times. He is also one among 3 captains to win multiple IPL titles. Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni are the two others to have done the same. He is the 3rd highest run getter against KXIP in the IPL scoring 671 runs in 21 matches against them. He has a strike rate of 125.18 and a balls/boundary rate of 5.96. He has scored 6 half centuries against KXIP. Only Chris Gayle (797 runs) and Suresh Raina (683 runs) have scored more against KXIP in the IPL. Delhi Daredevils head coach Ricky Ponting has exuded optimism and said that he doesn't care about his team's dismal record over 10 editions of IPL as he believes that the \"fresh group\" of players have it in them to win a maiden title this season. 18:20(IST) \nKings XI Punjab started off their IPL campaign in style as they registered a comfortable 6-wicket win against Delhi Daredevils in Mohali. After being set a target of 167, KL Rahul got Punjab to a blistering start as he smashed fastest fifty in IPL history, in just 14 balls. When Rahul was batting Punjab was cruising at 52/0 in three overs, with the other opener—Mayank Agarwal batting at 2. The right-hander eventually got out at 51 after hitting six fours and four sixes. But after Rahul’s departure, Punjab lost its way somewhat, as they lost one more wicket quickly, and their run-rate dropped drastically. Yuvraj Singh, who came in at no. 3, couldn’t really produce the desired performance as he could only score 12 runs from 22 balls. After Yuvraj’s departure, Karun Nair (50) and David Miller (24) did the damage control and took the team to a safe position. Nair started slowly, but picked up his scoring rate once he got his eye in. The match was finished well by Marcus Stoinis who smacked 22 runs from 15 balls. It was a disappointing show by Delhi bowlers, as they could not control the flow of boundaries in the innings. Mohamed Shami gave away 26 runs from his two overs, while Amit Mishra leaked 46 runs in his 4 overs. Though Dan Christian and Rahul Tewatia bowled well but that didn’t prove enough. Earlier in the day, after choosing to bowl first, Kings XI Punjab did well to restrict Delhi to just 166 runs in their allotted 20 overs. It was due to skipper Gautam Gambhir’s 42-ball 55, that Delhi could post that kind of total. Gambhir’s innings involved five fours and one six, but the team could not continue the momentum he gave them. After his departure, there were quick-fire innings from the bat of Rishabh Pant (28) and Chris Morris (27), but that was never going to be enough, seeing the strong batting line-up of Punjab. It would be fair to say Delhi could have managed a better total, if not for an unpredictable batting order. Delhi sent in Vijay Shankar before the hard-hitting Pant, and an unknown Rahul Tewatia before all-rounder Chris Morris. One of the problems that came to the fore for Delhi was that they couldn’t string big partnerships in the middle of the innings, and kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Their highest partnership of the day came between Gambhir and Shreyas Iyer, who stitched 42 runs together. As far as Punjab’s bowling is concerned, the match marked a dream debut for Afghanistan youngster Mujeeb Ur Rahman. The 17-year-old, who became the youngest cricketer ever to play in the IPL, returned with figures of 2/28 in his four overs. Ravichandran Ashwin, in his first match as skipper did well and bagged one wicket conceding 23 runs only. The lanky spinner bowled some of his leg-spinners too, that were a difficult to pick for the batsmen. He somewhat managed to put brakes on the scoring rate, after pacer Andrew Tye and Axar Patel gave 38 and 35 runs, respectively. 18:18(IST) \nRajasthan Royals captain Ajinkya Rahane has lamented the team's failure to build a single partnership of note following their loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The Sunisers restricted RR to 125/9 and chased down the target with nine wickets and 25 balls to spare. \"We thought on this wicket, 150-160 would have been ideal total because ball was doing the bit and medium pacers got good help. But, we didn't get that one partnership. I think we lost crucial wickets in between. Partnership was the key in between,\" Rahane said at the post-match press conference late last night. Observing that it is just the beginning of the tournament, he expressed confidence that the team would give its best in the coming matches. Replying to a query, he said the team's overseas players, including Ben Stokes, Jos Butler and D'Arcy Short, are very competent players. \"I think foreigners who played, they are really good. D'Arcy Short, he did really well in Big Bash, did well for Australia recently, Joss Butler and Stokes, we all know how dangerous they are and Ben Laughlin is an experienced bowler in T20 cricket,\" he said. Australia's Steve Smith stepped down as captain in the wake of the ball tampering row, and Rajasthan are now focused on achieving success with the available resources in hand. \"Definitely, Steve Smith is a quality player. We are not thinking about him right now. It's all about how we can contribute.\" He appreciated Sunrisers bowlers Siddharth Kaul and Billy Stanlake for their performance. \"He (Kaul) bowled well. I think him, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Stanlake, three of them they bowled really well. I think Siddharth Kaul, he changed his pace really well. He was bowling, hitting the length hard and that was the key aspect\" he said. 18:07(IST) \nHello and welcome to the LIVE coverage of the game between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Daredevils. Smarting from a crushing defeat at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad in their opening fixture, Rajasthan Royals will look to seek home comfort and register a win when they take on Delhi Daredevils, who lost against Kings XI Punjab, in an Indian Premier League (IPL) clash here on Wednesday. Back at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium after serving a two-year ban, Rajasthan, under spin legend Shane Warne, had nothing going their way against Hyderabad. Royals huffed and puffed to 125/9 after being asked to bat, and then saw Hyderabad canter home with nine wickets in hand. Sanju Samson was the only shining light for the inaugural champions with a watchful 42-ball 49 as star batsman and skipper Ajinkya Rahane fell for 13 and only Rahul Tripathi (17) and Shreyas Gopal (18) managed to reach double figures. The second wicket did stand for 46 runs while the fourth-wicket stand stitched together 29 off just 13 deliveries. Both the partnerships could have shaped the innings well but failed miserably. \"Getting a good start in the first six overs, that was the key, and we got that,\" Rahane had said after the match. \"Six overs and we were close to 50 with one wicket down. But we lost crucial wickets in the middle overs. \"I always believed that it was a wicket where one big partnership or (if) one set batsman can bat through the innings that really would've helped.\" Hyderabad bowlers proved to be hot for Rajasthan and what made matters worse was how their bowlers meekly surrended in the face of Shikhar Dhawan's 57-ball 78. Against Delhi, the hosts will need to improve on every count. What would go in their favour is that their opponents also come into the game having not done well against Kings XI Punjab in their opener. Newly appointed captain Gautam Gambhir (55) led from the front but lacked support around him. Delhi's batting is not that strong either with lack of experieneced names effecting the middle order. Lokesh Rahul's 16-ball 55 -- fastest IPL fifty -- made matters worse for them but a cause of worry for Delhi is seamer Mohammed Shami going for a lot of runs as Delhi will want him to deliver alongwith New Zealand pacer Trent Boult. Delhi will start as favourites against Rajasthan but unlike their first match if the likes of in-form D'Arcy Short, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler or Ben Laughlin fire on the morrow, it could well be Rajasthan's field day at home as all the players have reputation of turning the game around. \nBen Stokes (BCCI Photo) LATEST UPDATES: Gautam Gambhir wins the toss and Delhi will bowl first as Gambhir feels that the pitch will remain the same and there could be dew later in the evening. Rahane says toss is not in one's hand and he is happy to bat first. PREVIEW RR vs DD: Rajasthan Royals will need to regroup quickly after a heavy loss when they face Delhi Daredevils in what will be their first IPL home game in five years at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Wednesday. The live telecast of the match will start at 8 PM on April 11(Wednesday) The match can be seen live on the Star Sports network and live streaming will be available on hotstar.com. You can also follow our live blog for ball-by-ball updates and analysis on cricketnext.com. Both Royals and Daredevils were outplayed in their opening games and will be itching to bounce back. Daredevils were severely hit by K.L. Rahul's fastest fifty against Kings XI Punjab, losing in Mohali by six wickets. Royals, on the other hand, could never cope with the bowling might of Sunrisers Hyderabad and went down by nine wickets in Hyderabad. It was a rather forgettable opening for the hosts who are making a comeback in the tournament after serving a two-year suspension. Skipper Ajinkya Rahane too would like to forget the outing where he failed with the bat, missed a sitter in slips and also gambled with batting only to see a complete rout of his team. The comfort zone of playing at home may give the desired dose of much needed confidence but the cracks exposed against Sunrisers need to be addressed quickly. The batting order in absence of Steve Smith looked brittle, the overseas players including Ben Stokes looked shaky against the spinners and the bowlers lost heart once the batsmen could put only 125 on the board. Barring a 49 by Sanju Samson, none of other the batsmen showed any confidence nor they could build any partnerships. The shrewd cricketing brain and mentor of the side, legendary Shane Warne, will have to lift the morale of the side and he might use the success stories of home ground to motivate his men. The hosts have the resources with experienced overseas players and local talent under a calm and cool Rahane but they need to get their act together. They face Daredevils who are still in shock and feel that despite doing all good, it was just Rahul's lightning fifty which took the match away from them. The skipper Gautam Gambhir looked good and determined during his 55 and Rishabh Pant and Morris too contributed. They also have a good and experienced bowling side with Boult, Md. Shami, Morris and Amit Mishra in the forefront. The biggest factor for the Delhi Daredevils is the presence of Gambhir as skipper. He is eager to prove his prowess and leads the side with aggression. The weather in the Pink City has been cloudy with a little bit of drizzle. “We were hit hard by the RCA ban. Despite financial crunch we maintained the wicket and the outfield. There has not been much cricket on it but we have tried hard to sustain grass on it because it is this ingrown grass which binds the soil of the wicket. It is not the 200 run kind of wicket but 160-170 would be achievable because ball would come nicely on to the bat. The bowlers would also have something for them. They might find good bounce out of this surface,” said veteran curator Taposh Chatterjee. Playing XI: Delhi Daredevils: Colin Munro, Gautam Gambhir(c), Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh Pant(w), Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Shahbaz Nadeem, Trent Boult, Mohammed Shami Rajasthan Royals: Ajinkya Rahane(c), D Arcy Short, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Jos Buttler(w), Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin",

Shami bowled a yorker and Buttler went for the a sweep shot but missed it completely. The ball crashed into the stumps as RR lose their fifth wicket. 21:21(IST) \nSIX: On the first ball of the 18th over, a full delivery from Shami is dispatched for a huge six by Buttler over long off for a huge six. Stunning stuff from the Englishman as he is taking apart the bowling line-up. 21:17(IST) \nSIX and SIX: Rahul Tripathi hoinks the ball over the in-field towards the mid-wicket region and just before it went over the ropes, Boult tried to catch it and keep it inside but couldn't keep it in. Then, Buttler hit a six over the bowler's head for the second maximum of the over. Buttler then made it 18 from the over as he hit a boundary on the second last ball of the Chris Morris over. 21:12(IST) \nJos Buttler and Rahul Tripathi are not able to score the big ones here but they are taking the singles and doubles to keep the scoreboard ticking. While at the same time, Rahul Tripathi is bowling really well and he hasn't given any loose deliveries thus far. 21:09(IST) \nCricketnext's IPL expert AAkash Chopra: Rajasthan batting line-up was a bit strange once again. Samson did well last match and he was pushed down the order this time and Stokes was sent up. Rahul Tripathi has once pushed down the order. It is not making a lot of sense but that is how Rajasthan play their cricket. They tend to change quite a few things. 21:02(IST) \nOUT: Shahbaz Nadeem has done the trick once again as he picks his second of the game and gets rid of Ajinkya Rahane for 45. The ball took a leading edge off the bat and Morris took an easy catch on the off side inside the circle. RR lose their fourth. 20:58(IST) \nFour and Four: Ajinkya Rahane takes the attack to Mohammed Shami as he hits back to back boundaries off the the bowling of his India teammate. Firs, he came dancing down the track and hit the ball through the covers for a four. And then, on the next ball, he lobbed the ball high in the air on the lef-side. Boult who came in running and tried to take a diving one-handed catch but the ball touched his fingers and went for a four. With that, RR go past the 100-run mark as well. 20:53(IST) \nFour: Jos Buttler has hit the ground running as he hits a boundary on the second ball that he face. After a taking a double on the first ball, Buttler hit the reverse sweep which went behind the keeper for his first four. Great stuff from the Englishman as 9 runs came from that Tewatia over. 20:52(IST) \nStat Attack: This is the third successive IPL match where Nadeem has struck. It’s also the fourth successive match he’s struck against the Royals in the IPL. Great stuff for the ace spinner. \n20:50(IST) \nOUT: Nadeem has broken the partnership as he castles Samson for 37. Samson went for the sweep shot and the ball took an inside edge and hit the stumps. RR has lost their third wicket as Jos Buttler comes out to bat now with skipper Rahane. 20:45(IST) \n50: Following the time-out, Tewatia comes onto bowl and Samson takes a single to complete the 50-run partnership between the two batsmen. Then, Rahane gets into the act and pulls the ball on the onside for a boundary. Great stuff from the two batsmen as they take 7 runs from this over. 20:41(IST) \nStat Attack: Samson at #4 in the IPL has never managed a 50, prior to today. His his highest is 47* against KXIP at Mohali (2013). He has four 30+ scores in 14 prior innings in the IPL at this position. Will this stat change today? Samson is currently batting on 31 off 16 deliveries. \n20:38(IST) \nSIX and Four: Nadeem comes onto bowl again and this time he drops the ball a bit short. Samson seemed to be ready for it and hoinked it over deep mid-wicket for a huge six. And then, on the next delivery, a cheeky cut and the ball went for a four behind the keeper. 20:36(IST) \nExcellent first over to start the proceedings for Tewatia as he concedes just four runs from it. Gambhir will be delighted with the way his spinner bowled his first over as the pacers went for quiet some runs early on. Delhi will have to keep the flow of runs in check in order to create some pressure. 20:34(IST) \nShami concedes seven runs from his first over and Rajsthan will be happy with that as the two batsmen are playing almost next to nil dot ball. Rahul Tewatia comes on to bowl now as Delhi look to break this partnership. 20:32(IST) \nStat Attack: The last time Rahane played Delhi at Jaipur he scored 63* off 45 balls: A knock he won the man of the match award for. The RR skipper seems to be on a similar path today as well. 20:30(IST) \nFour: Mohammed Shami comes onto attack and straight away he is hit for a boundary. The pacer dropped the ball a bit short and Rahane pulled the ball for a boundary towards mid-wicket. These two are building a good partnership now. \nThe ground staff pulling the covers over the pitch at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium in Jaipur. (BCCI Photo) LATEST UPDATES: No chance of ground inspection as rain returns in Jaipur. PREVIEW RR vs DD: Rajasthan Royals will need to regroup quickly after a heavy loss when they face Delhi Daredevils in what will be their first IPL home game in five years at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Wednesday. The live telecast of the match will start at 8 PM on April 11(Wednesday) The match can be seen live on the Star Sports network and live streaming will be available on hotstar.com. You can also follow our live blog for ball-by-ball updates and analysis on cricketnext.com. Both Royals and Daredevils were outplayed in their opening games and will be itching to bounce back. Daredevils were severely hit by K.L. Rahul's fastest fifty against Kings XI Punjab, losing in Mohali by six wickets. Royals, on the other hand, could never cope with the bowling might of Sunrisers Hyderabad and went down by nine wickets in Hyderabad. It was a rather forgettable opening for the hosts who are making a comeback in the tournament after serving a two-year suspension. Skipper Ajinkya Rahane too would like to forget the outing where he failed with the bat, missed a sitter in slips and also gambled with batting only to see a complete rout of his team. The comfort zone of playing at home may give the desired dose of much needed confidence but the cracks exposed against Sunrisers need to be addressed quickly. The batting order in absence of Steve Smith looked brittle, the overseas players including Ben Stokes looked shaky against the spinners and the bowlers lost heart once the batsmen could put only 125 on the board. Barring a 49 by Sanju Samson, none of other the batsmen showed any confidence nor they could build any partnerships. The shrewd cricketing brain and mentor of the side, legendary Shane Warne, will have to lift the morale of the side and he might use the success stories of home ground to motivate his men. The hosts have the resources with experienced overseas players and local talent under a calm and cool Rahane but they need to get their act together. They face Daredevils who are still in shock and feel that despite doing all good, it was just Rahul's lightning fifty which took the match away from them. The skipper Gautam Gambhir looked good and determined during his 55 and Rishabh Pant and Morris too contributed. They also have a good and experienced bowling side with Boult, Md. Shami, Morris and Amit Mishra in the forefront. The biggest factor for the Delhi Daredevils is the presence of Gambhir as skipper. He is eager to prove his prowess and leads the side with aggression. The weather in the Pink City has been cloudy with a little bit of drizzle. “We were hit hard by the RCA ban. Despite financial crunch we maintained the wicket and the outfield. There has not been much cricket on it but we have tried hard to sustain grass on it because it is this ingrown grass which binds the soil of the wicket. It is not the 200 run kind of wicket but 160-170 would be achievable because ball would come nicely on to the bat. The bowlers would also have something for them. They might find good bounce out of this surface,” said veteran curator Taposh Chatterjee. Playing XI: Delhi Daredevils: Colin Munro, Gautam Gambhir(c), Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh Pant(w), Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Shahbaz Nadeem, Trent Boult, Mohammed Shami Rajasthan Royals: Ajinkya Rahane(c), D Arcy Short, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Jos Buttler(w), Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin",

The hosts lose their second wicket bow as Sanju Samson comes out to bat. 20:18(IST) \nFour: Ben Stokes seems to have decided that attack is the best form of defence and he is taking the attack to the Delhi bowlers. On the third ball of the over, Stokes pulls a Morris delivery over mid-wicket for the first six of the innings. Stunning start for Stokes. 20:15(IST) \nChris Morris has now come into the attack in place of Nadeem as Delhi look to further dent the Rajasthan line-up. One wicket here for Delhi and the pressure will be on Rajasthan who hasn't got off to a good start whatsoever. Rahane and Stokes are trying to build a good partnership here. 20:13(IST) \nAnother good over from Boult as he gives away just five runs from it. Yes, there was boundary from it but other than than, there was just one single and other deliveries were dot balls. Gambhir will be happy how his bowlers have bowled thus far in the innings. 20:11(IST) \nFour: Ben Stokes has come out early and he has made his intentions clear by hitting Boult for a stunning boundary. Stokes came dancing down the track and hit the ball through the covers for a boundary. Good start for the southpaw. 20:08(IST) \nOUT: Short hit the first Nadeem delivery for a boundary, but then on the next ball he is dismissed, courtesy of a stunning peice of fielding by Vijay Shankar. After hitting the ball on the on side, the batsmen went for a double, but Shankar hit the stumps directly and afffected the run out. First blood to Delhi. 20:05(IST) \nExcellent first over from Boult to start the proceedings as he gives away just just 6 runs from it and doesn't concede a single boundary. Shahbaz Nadeem comes onto bowl now. He has come into the side in place of Amit Mishra who was taken for runs in the previous game against SRH. 20:01(IST) \nRahane and Short have made their way into the middle and Trent Boult is bowling the first over of the match. Rahane gets off the mark with a double and the onus will be on these two to score some runs early on. 19:56(IST) \nThe onus will be on Rajasthan openers Rahane and Short to provide their team with an ideal start. But at this ground, out of four matches Rajasthan has won three matches and therefore enjoy a much better head to head record. With so many batting powerhouses in their ranks, Rajasthan will look to start with a bang in front of their home ground. 19:46(IST) \nDew factor has forced Gambhir to bowl first and Rahane agreed to it during the toss. Even Rajasthan wanted to bowl first due to the dew factor which will make it difficult for bowling in the later stages of the match. 19:41(IST) \nBoth team lost their respective opening matches and will look to get back to winning ways in this clash. While Delhi will look to Glenn Maxwell, who returns after missing the first match due to personal reasons. As for Rajasthan, they are playing the same squad as last time and will look at their big money signings to fire. 19:36(IST) \nTeams: Rajasthan Royals (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane(c), D Arcy Short, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Jos Buttler(w), Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin Delhi Daredevils (Playing XI): Colin Munro, Gautam Gambhir(c), Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh Pant(w), Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Shahbaz Nadeem, Trent Boult, Mohammed Shami 19:35(IST) \nAt the TOSS, Gambhir: Looks a good wicket, won't change much. Perhaps dew will come in. That's why we are chasing. Just the start of the tournament, need to get the combination right. We have the full squad now. Maxi is back and we all know how dangerous he can be. Important to get the combinations right and hopefully we can do it. Two changes - Nadeem for Mishra, Maxwell for Christian. Rahane: We would have bowled as well but as I said, toss isn't in our control. We will look to bat well and put runs on the board. I think the boys have adjusted to the conditions well, especially the overseas ones. They are experienced campaigners. We are unchanged. \n19:32(IST) \nTOSS NEWS: Gautam Gambhir wins the toss and Delhi will bowl first as Gambhir feels that the pitch will remain the same and there could be dew later in the evening. Rahane says toss is not in one's hand and he is happy to bat first. Same team for RR and Nadeem comes in for Mishra for DD. Maxwell comes in for Christian. 19:25(IST) \nBanned for life from cricket activities, former Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra on Friday said he has filed a petition in the Supreme Court after Delhi Police gave him a clean chit in the Indian Premier League betting scandal. Kundra had filed an application under Right To Information at the Delhi Police who in their reply said there's \"no evidence\" of betting charges against him. \"We have filed an application under RTI to Delhi police seeking whether there's any evidence against me on the alleged betting,\" Kundra told reporters on the sidelines of an Indian Chambers of Commerce programme. \"The answer we got against the RTI is that they have no evidence against me, and I have nothing to do with betting. The RTI is available to all of you. Even you can file an RTI and see it.\" Kundra and then ICC chief N Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan were suspended from any type of cricket matches for life after they were found guilty of betting in the T20 tournament. The Supreme Court-appointed committee in its 2015 verdict had also suspended former champions Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals for two years. The two franchises will be back this season after serving two years suspensions and Kundra hoped the ban is overturned and he is back to resume duties at the Rajasthan Royals. \"I hope so (the ban is overturned). We have submitted it and I don't know the date of a hearing. It's in the courts. We all have trust in the judicial systems. Fingers crossed. In our review (petition) we have asked please see what the Delhi Police has said and the basis on which I've been banned for life. Please study the new evidence, study them and tell us if I committed any crime. Then I will accept it. If Delhi Police is clearly saying I've done 'nothing wrong, why penalise me', why I'm being victimised.\" LOAD MORE LATEST UPDATES: Nadeem has broken the partnership as he gets Rahane for 45. Rajasthan four down. PREVIEW RR vs DD: Rajasthan Royals will need to regroup quickly after a heavy loss when they face Delhi Daredevils in what will be their first IPL home game in five years at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Wednesday. The live telecast of the match will start at 8 PM on April 11(Wednesday) The match can be seen live on the Star Sports network and live streaming will be available on hotstar.com. You can also follow our live blog for ball-by-ball updates and analysis on cricketnext.com. Both Royals and Daredevils were outplayed in their opening games and will be itching to bounce back. Daredevils were severely hit by K.L. Rahul's fastest fifty against Kings XI Punjab, losing in Mohali by six wickets. Royals, on the other hand, could never cope with the bowling might of Sunrisers Hyderabad and went down by nine wickets in Hyderabad. It was a rather forgettable opening for the hosts who are making a comeback in the tournament after serving a two-year suspension. Skipper Ajinkya Rahane too would like to forget the outing where he failed with the bat, missed a sitter in slips and also gambled with batting only to see a complete rout of his team. The comfort zone of playing at home may give the desired dose of much needed confidence but the cracks exposed against Sunrisers need to be addressed quickly. The batting order in absence of Steve Smith looked brittle, the overseas players including Ben Stokes looked shaky against the spinners and the bowlers lost heart once the batsmen could put only 125 on the board. Barring a 49 by Sanju Samson, none of other the batsmen showed any confidence nor they could build any partnerships. The shrewd cricketing brain and mentor of the side, legendary Shane Warne, will have to lift the morale of the side and he might use the success stories of home ground to motivate his men. The hosts have the resources with experienced overseas players and local talent under a calm and cool Rahane but they need to get their act together. They face Daredevils who are still in shock and feel that despite doing all good, it was just Rahul's lightning fifty which took the match away from them. The skipper Gautam Gambhir looked good and determined during his 55 and Rishabh Pant and Morris too contributed. They also have a good and experienced bowling side with Boult, Md. Shami, Morris and Amit Mishra in the forefront. The biggest factor for the Delhi Daredevils is the presence of Gambhir as skipper. He is eager to prove his prowess and leads the side with aggression. The weather in the Pink City has been cloudy with a little bit of drizzle. “We were hit hard by the RCA ban. Despite financial crunch we maintained the wicket and the outfield. There has not been much cricket on it but we have tried hard to sustain grass on it because it is this ingrown grass which binds the soil of the wicket. It is not the 200 run kind of wicket but 160-170 would be achievable because ball would come nicely on to the bat. The bowlers would also have something for them. They might find good bounce out of this surface,” said veteran curator Taposh Chatterjee. Playing XI: Delhi Daredevils: Colin Munro, Gautam Gambhir(c), Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh Pant(w), Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Shahbaz Nadeem, Trent Boult, Mohammed Shami Rajasthan Royals: Ajinkya Rahane(c), D Arcy Short, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Jos Buttler(w), Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin",

      "text": "IPL 2018 Live Score Cricket, RR vs DD: Play Interrupted Due to Rain After Rajasthan Reach 153/5 Cricketnext Staff | Updated: April 11, 2018, 10:05 PM IST Match 6, Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur 11 April, 2018 Live Now : Toss won by Delhi Daredevils (decided to bowl) Four: Ben Stokes has come out early and he has made his intentions clear by hitting Boult for a stunning boundary. Stokes came dancing down the track and hit the ball through the covers for a boundary. Good start for the southpaw. 22:13(IST) \nUPDATE: Its is still raining cats and dogs in Jaipur and things aren't looking good. Although the drainage system is good here, but it will still take some time for the ground staff to ready the ground. As things stands, we will be losing some overs here. 22:03(IST) \nUPDATE: Things are still not looking good as it is still raining in Jaipur. Although it has slowed down a bit but it is still drizzling. The ground staff cannot start their work till the time the rain doesn't stop completely. Stay tuned folks for more updates. 21:53(IST) \nUpdate: We have another half an hour before the overs will start reducing. The official word from the venue says that the rain is still coming down a bit hard and it will take a bit of time to stop. Fingers crossed folks. 21:40(IST) Play has been interrupted due to rain in Jaipur. @rajasthanroyals 153/5 in 17.5 overs. Stay tuned for further updates. #RRvDD #VIVOIPL pic.twitter.com/MFIy0AKR7h — IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 11, 2018 21:40(IST) \nUPDATE: The rain has gotten heavier in the past minutes and it is not looking good at the moment. But still, there is lot of time left before the overs will start reducing. Let's hope it will end soon for the ground staff to work their magic the ready it in time. 21:31(IST) \nJust to let the readers know, overs won't be lost before 10:29 PM IST and as things stand, we will have a full match. Let's hope it begins soon as it was a entertaining match to watch before rain gods decided to step in. 21:26(IST) \nRAIN: Bad news for the fans as the match has been interrupted due to rain. Hopefully it is just a passing shower and the play will resume soon. As things stand, Rajasthan are 153/5 in 17.5 overs. 21:24(IST) \nOUT: Mohammed Shami has done the trick as he gets rid of Jos Buttler for 29. Shami bowled a yorker and Buttler went for the a sweep shot but missed it completely. The ball crashed into the stumps as RR lose their fifth wicket. 21:21(IST) \nSIX: On the first ball of the 18th over, a full delivery from Shami is dispatched for a huge six by Buttler over long off for a huge six. Stunning stuff from the Englishman as he is taking apart the bowling line-up. 21:17(IST) \nSIX and SIX: Rahul Tripathi hoinks the ball over the in-field towards the mid-wicket region and just before it went over the ropes, Boult tried to catch it and keep it inside but couldn't keep it in. Then, Buttler hit a six over the bowler's head for the second maximum of the over. Buttler then made it 18 from the over as he hit a boundary on the second last ball of the Chris Morris over. 21:12(IST) \nJos Buttler and Rahul Tripathi are not able to score the big ones here but they are taking the singles and doubles to keep the scoreboard ticking. While at the same time, Rahul Tripathi is bowling really well and he hasn't given any loose deliveries thus far. 21:09(IST) \nCricketnext's IPL expert AAkash Chopra: Rajasthan batting line-up was a bit strange once again. Samson did well last match and he was pushed down the order this time and Stokes was sent up. Rahul Tripathi has once pushed down the order. It is not making a lot of sense but that is how Rajasthan play their cricket. They tend to change quite a few things. 21:02(IST) \nOUT: Shahbaz Nadeem has done the trick once again as he picks his second of the game and gets rid of Ajinkya Rahane for 45. The ball took a leading edge off the bat and Morris took an easy catch on the off side inside the circle. RR lose their fourth. 20:58(IST) \nFour and Four: Ajinkya Rahane takes the attack to Mohammed Shami as he hits back to back boundaries off the the bowling of his India teammate. Firs, he came dancing down the track and hit the ball through the covers for a four. And then, on the next ball, he lobbed the ball high in the air on the lef-side. Boult who came in running and tried to take a diving one-handed catch but the ball touched his fingers and went for a four. With that, RR go past the 100-run mark as well. 20:53(IST) \nFour: Jos Buttler has hit the ground running as he hits a boundary on the second ball that he face. After a taking a double on the first ball, Buttler hit the reverse sweep which went behind the keeper for his first four. Great stuff from the Englishman as 9 runs came from that Tewatia over. 20:52(IST) \nStat Attack: This is the third successive IPL match where Nadeem has struck. It’s also the fourth successive match he’s struck against the Royals in the IPL. Great stuff for the ace spinner. \n20:50(IST) \nOUT: Nadeem has broken the partnership as he castles Samson for 37. Samson went for the sweep shot and the ball took an inside edge and hit the stumps. RR has lost their third wicket as Jos Buttler comes out to bat now with skipper Rahane. 20:45(IST) \n50: Following the time-out, Tewatia comes onto bowl and Samson takes a single to complete the 50-run partnership between the two batsmen. Then, Rahane gets into the act and pulls the ball on the onside for a boundary. Great stuff from the two batsmen as they take 7 runs from this over. 20:41(IST) \nStat Attack: Samson at #4 in the IPL has never managed a 50, prior to today. His his highest is 47* against KXIP at Mohali (2013). He has four 30+ scores in 14 prior innings in the IPL at this position. Will this stat change today? Samson is currently batting on 31 off 16 deliveries. \n20:38(IST) \nSIX and Four: Nadeem comes onto bowl again and this time he drops the ball a bit short. Samson seemed to be ready for it and hoinked it over deep mid-wicket for a huge six. And then, on the next delivery, a cheeky cut and the ball went for a four behind the keeper. 20:36(IST) \nExcellent first over to start the proceedings for Tewatia as he concedes just four runs from it. Gambhir will be delighted with the way his spinner bowled his first over as the pacers went for quiet some runs early on. Delhi will have to keep the flow of runs in check in order to create some pressure. 20:34(IST) \nShami concedes seven runs from his first over and Rajsthan will be happy with that as the two batsmen are playing almost next to nil dot ball. Rahul Tewatia comes on to bowl now as Delhi look to break this partnership. 20:32(IST) \nStat Attack: The last time Rahane played Delhi at Jaipur he scored 63* off 45 balls: A knock he won the man of the match award for. The RR skipper seems to be on a similar path today as well. 20:30(IST) \nFour: Mohammed Shami comes onto attack and straight away he is hit for a boundary. The pacer dropped the ball a bit short and Rahane pulled the ball for a boundary towards mid-wicket. These two are building a good partnership now. 20:28(IST) \n50: Rahane and Samson are milking the bowling really well at the moment. The duo are taking singles and doubles at will with occasional boundaries. In this Morris over they scored: 3,1,1,1,1,1. With that, Rajasthan also cross the 50-run mark in 6 overs. 20:24(IST) \nFour,SIX and Four: Sanju Samson has issued a stunning fightback after Rajasthan has lost two early wickets. On the first ball that he face, he hits a perfect drive on the off side and then on the next delivery, he pulls Boult for a huge six over mid-wicket. Then on the last ball of the over, Rahane joins the party and flicks the ball for a four. 15 runs came from the Boult over. 20:20(IST) \nOUT: The decision to persist with Boult has worked wonders for Gambhir as he picks up the crucial wicket of Stokes. A super outswinger and Stokes edges the ball straight into the hands of the wicket-keeper. The hosts lose their second wicket bow as Sanju Samson comes out to bat. 20:18(IST) \nFour: Ben Stokes seems to have decided that attack is the best form of defence and he is taking the attack to the Delhi bowlers. On the third ball of the over, Stokes pulls a Morris delivery over mid-wicket for the first six of the innings. Stunning start for Stokes. 20:15(IST) \nChris Morris has now come into the attack in place of Nadeem as Delhi look to further dent the Rajasthan line-up. One wicket here for Delhi and the pressure will be on Rajasthan who hasn't got off to a good start whatsoever. Rahane and Stokes are trying to build a good partnership here. 20:13(IST) \nAnother good over from Boult as he gives away just five runs from it. Yes, there was boundary from it but other than than, there was just one single and other deliveries were dot balls. Gambhir will be happy how his bowlers have bowled thus far in the innings. 20:11(IST) \nFour: Ben Stokes has come out early and he has made his intentions clear by hitting Boult for a stunning boundary. Stokes came dancing down the track and hit the ball through the covers for a boundary. Good start for the southpaw.

The comfort zone of playing at home may give the desired dose of much needed confidence but the cracks exposed against Sunrisers need to be addressed quickly. The batting order in absence of Steve Smith looked brittle, the overseas players including Ben Stokes looked shaky against the spinners and the bowlers lost heart once the batsmen could put only 125 on the board. Barring a 49 by Sanju Samson, none of other the batsmen showed any confidence nor they could build any partnerships. The shrewd cricketing brain and mentor of the side, legendary Shane Warne, will have to lift the morale of the side and he might use the success stories of home ground to motivate his men. The hosts have the resources with experienced overseas players and local talent under a calm and cool Rahane but they need to get their act together. They face Daredevils who are still in shock and feel that despite doing all good, it was just Rahul's lightning fifty which took the match away from them. The skipper Gautam Gambhir looked good and determined during his 55 and Rishabh Pant and Morris too contributed. They also have a good and experienced bowling side with Boult, Md. Shami, Morris and Amit Mishra in the forefront. The biggest factor for the Delhi Daredevils is the presence of Gambhir as skipper. He is eager to prove his prowess and leads the side with aggression. The weather in the Pink City has been cloudy with a little bit of drizzle. “We were hit hard by the RCA ban. Despite financial crunch we maintained the wicket and the outfield. There has not been much cricket on it but we have tried hard to sustain grass on it because it is this ingrown grass which binds the soil of the wicket. It is not the 200 run kind of wicket but 160-170 would be achievable because ball would come nicely on to the bat. The bowlers would also have something for them. They might find good bounce out of this surface,” said veteran curator Taposh Chatterjee. Playing XI: Delhi Daredevils: Colin Munro, Gautam Gambhir(c), Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh Pant(w), Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Shahbaz Nadeem, Trent Boult, Mohammed Shami Rajasthan Royals: Ajinkya Rahane(c), D Arcy Short, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Jos Buttler(w), Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin",

Sharath, who was part of the 2006 Melbourne CWG gold medal winning squad, feels that the 2018 gold is in a way a redemption for failing in the 2014 edition at Glasgow. It's a great feeling to win the gold for our country especially when you see the tricolour going up while our National Anthem is playing is the best feeling one can ever watch, Sharath told IANS from Gold Coast in an email interview. We came in as the favourites in this edition of the CWG as we were seeded No.1 and finished as the No.1. So everything went according to plan and all of us delivered what was expected from us. We have won the gold in the team event after 12 years, so this was the redemption for not winning it in 2014, he added. Acknowledging the pressure for missing out in Glasgow four years ago, Sharath said it helped him deliver as the captain of the side in the crunch semi-final 3-2 win against Singapore. There was a lot of pressure as last time in 2014 we had only one silver in men's doubles where I was partnering Amalraj Anthony, so we have won back the medals we won in 2010. So with that pressure more on me as the captain of the team, I had to focus on my performance along with motivating the team to do well, he said. It was a bit hard but when I stood strong against Singapore in the semis by winning both my singles 3-0, the team gained a lot of confidence and with this confidence we blanked out Nigeria 3-0 in the final, he added. Commenting on the team combination which comprises youngsters like Sathiyan Gnanasekaran, Harmeet Desai and Salil Shankar Shetty, Sharath said: We have had a great side with old and young players, Amalraj and myself being the elder players and with Sathiyan, Harmeet and Sanil being the younger players who have been doing very well currently on the world circuit. Sathiyan especially has had a great year in 2017 and doing extremely well with being the highest ranked among us at No.47 in the world. His partnership with Harmeet in the doubles was commendable and they won the important double match against Singapore while I won my two singles. We work very well as a team and since the last two years we have been rising the benchmark to a very high level, he added. Asked about the reason for the gradual rise of Indian paddlers at the international stage, Sharath said: The reason of all this improvement with six men players in top-100 in the world and 2 women players also there is due to the administrative and organisation of Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) and Sports Authority of India (SAI). They hired a a foreign coach, Massimo Costantini, in 2016 when we won the second division of the world championships and there has been a steady and consequent program of training and tournaments for over two years which has helped us win this gold medal. We have had sufficient funding from SAI which was utilised in the right manner by TTFI to help the players, he added. Sharath also appeared confident of boosting India's medal tally in individual events, which started on Wednesday. From tomorrow (Thursday) singles, doubles and mixed doubles start off where in men's doubles I am partnering Sathiyan and we are the top seeds, we could win if not a gold medal, another medal for sure in that event and singles is always open and I hope to win one medal in the singles too, he said. Asked if the CWG team gold will act as a booster for the Asian Games, where the level of competition is comparatively higher with the power-houses like Japan, China and South Korea, taking part, he said: Asian Games is a much more competitive tournament as Asia is the power house for table tennis, he acknowledged. We have always played the quarter-finals there but this time if we have a good draw there is small outside chance to win a medal in the team championships. And also the confidence from the CWG will be a major contribution for our team at the Asians, he added. (Tridib Baparnash can be contacted at [email protected] ) --IANS",

      "text": "Jinoy Jose P T+ T- Two bluetooth speakers that impress with their price and specs \nWhat’s so common about Bluetooth speakers and the humble single-celled organism Amoeba? Well, both can come in any shape and form. Jokes apart, the gadgets market is now flooded with Bluetooth speakers of every size and shape that one can imagine. And almost all device-makers have a presence there. Here are two recent additions to the crowd, which stand out for their unique approach to an otherwise plebeian product. \nSunny side up \nZoook ZB-Solar Muse \nFrench consumer technology company Zoook has come up with what it calls India’s first ever solar-powered, waterproof speaker. The rectangular device has an integrated (and neatly placed) solar panel on the front, which when exposed to sunlight, charges the lithium battery. About 10 minutes of sunlight can get you around 30 minutes of audio playback. This faculty makes it a convenient audio device for outdoor use, especially given that speaker batteries are notoriously fast-burning. The Zoook ZB-Solar Muse has an impressively robust body that is shockproof, dustproof and suitably waterproof. (Of course, you’ll regret it if you’re going to dip it in a bucket). The ZB-Solar Muse offers 3D surround sound and is also charged via a USB cable. Zoook claims ZB-Solar Muse offers a 30-hour battery backup, depending on the environment and streaming specs. In our experience, the device recorded a playback time of up to 15-50 hours. The Muse uses aptX high definition technology to power its audio, which comes out crisp and noise-less. The device comes with two detachable, strong velcro straps that cyclists use to strap the speakers on to their bikes. It even has a built-in flashlight, which can come handy during excursions. \nClassy and crisp \nSYSKA Sound Cup \nThe SYSKA Sound Cup sports a classy look, with a rubber-and-fabric body and an appealing design. It offers a sound output of 24 W and a music playback time of up to eight hours on a single charge. The device has a 4,000 mAh battery and has a built-in microphone, which helps you attend calls even while listening to music. The Sound Cup also has a splash-proof design and has near-field communication (NFC) capability, which is a plus given the price tag. Syska offers a warranty period of one year. The 560-gram device gives really good bass and can be a good addition to your living room. It supports USB charging, has a 3.5 mm audio jack and hands-free audio calling. The device gets fully charged in just about five hours, which is quite impressive. The Sound Cup has the IPX4 waterproofing, which protects it from water splashes from all directions. \nThe device offers a wireless range of about 10 meters, which is also quite impressive in this price range. The volume dialler on the neck of the device is a cool innovation and can impress the young and the old alike. \nPrice: ₹6,999 \nPros: Good looks, high bass, strong audio output \nCons: No FM radio or SD card slot Published on",

      "text": "Shillong Golf Course sinking into disrepute   SHILLONG, April 11: One of the oldest, largest and finest natural golf circuits across the world, the Shillong Golf Course in Meghalaya is slowly turning into an eye sore with heaps of plastic bags, jay walkers, sports and merry making enthusiast littering and trampling over the serene greens of the course.This golf course was established in the year 1898, as a 9-hole golf course and later converted to an 18-hole course in 1924. \nOwing to its greenery and scenic beauty, the United States Golf Association and Museum has given it the title of ‘Gleneagles of the East’. The Golf Course has hosted many national and international tournaments and is known to be the golfers favourite. However, with the passage of time the Golf Course is facing the brunt of population explosion, lack of care and unregulated tourist inflow. The areas in an around the course are filled with litter and the grass is unkempt. The sad narrative of the destruction is very well found in the words of the caretaker and manager of the Shillong Golf Course, who has been taking care of the course since a long time now.“I am saddened by the way things are. People have no respect for the well trimmed grasses as they walk, run and lie down over it,” said the care taker who requested anonymity even as he fumed with anger especially against the picnickers and drunks who contribute more to the mess. Echoing similar sentiments, the President of the Shillong Golfers Association, AL Hek also expressed concern over the depleting condition of the golf course and said that they have now stopped playing golf owing to the bad condition and little or no response from the board of directors of the Shillong Club and also of the Shillong Golf Course.Hek maintained that the tourism department had also sanctioned funds for walls to be erected around the area and total support was also extended by the locals of the area, which however never materialized.The condition of the golf course may be deteriorating, but efforts are still on from concerned individuals and government alike to save it be it by organising cleaning drives or putting up no litter sign boards and now it all remains to be seen whether the public and the Board of Directors will rise up, play their part and do what is best to restore the course to its former glory.",

      "text": "Earlier Bhuvneshwar Kumar was more decent, innocent and now he has become smarter, reveals wife Nupur Nagar April 11, 2018 0 \nBhuvneshwar Kumar married his childhood sweetheart Nupur Nagar last year. \nIndia’s leading seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has been appointed as the vice-captain of Sunrisers Hyderabad. The decision to make him Kane Williamson’s deputy was taken after former skipper David Warner was suspended due to ball-tampering controversy in South Africa. In his new role, Kumar seemed at ease during SRH’s first match and is relishing the prospect of challenges that are about to come his way. In a recent interview with the Quint, Kumar revealed that he was informed of the development by coach Tom Moody. Kumar also said that he was pretty excited the day he was briefed about the decision. \n“One is excited about that responsibility. If you see our team there are a few new batsmen. In the last four years, our batting line-up has been the best. So hopefully we will do well this year,” he said. \nHowever, in the same talk show, wife Nupur Nagar also divulged a few secrets about the pacer and said that her husband was more decent before than now. “He was more decent and innocent and now he has become smarter,” Nupur said before Bhuvneshwar countered by saying, “It’s called maturity.” \nOn being asked if Bhuvi is as polite in real life like he is on camera, Nagar said, “No, that’s the public appearance.” \nWhen asked whether it is tough to manage time between themselves, considering Kumar’s busy schedule, Nupur added, “Somewhere very difficult because he is travelling all the time, but easy because we were friends and it is easier to manage post-marriage.” \nSunrisers Hyderabad have got off to a winning start in the Indian Premier League and are currently sitting second on the table. However, they will face a couple of stiff challenges in their upcoming matches, beginning with Mumbai Indians on Thursday and then Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday. \nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App Tags:",

(Source: AP) \nA celebratory dive into a Rome fountain has cost the chairman of AS Roma dear. \nJames Pallotta apologised on Wednesday for his late night plunge following Roma’s victory over Barcelona in the Champions League and promised to pay not just a 500 euro ($620) fine but also offered 230,000 euros to restore a separate city fountain. \n“We thank chairman Pallotta for his generosity after his dive yesterday,” said Rome mayor Virginia Raggi following a meeting with the U.S. businessman, who has been at the helm of AS Roma since 2012. \nRoma pulled off one of the great comebacks in European soccer history on Tuesday by knocking Barcelona out of the Champions League with a 3-0 win in their quarter-final second leg, overcoming a 4-1 deficit from the first game. \nCrowds took to the streets of the Italian capital after the final whistle to celebrate the victory, including in the central Piazza del Popolo, which has four small fountains built into the base of an ancient Egyptian obelisk. \nA video posted on the internet shows Pallotta taking off his jacket before deliberately falling backwards into the fountain to the cheers of surrounding fans. Anyone caught bathing in Rome’s plethora of fountains faces a 500-euro fine. \n“He has apologised. In a moment of exuberance he carried out this action, but he realises the importance of the example he has given, and he will clearly pay the fine,” Raggi said. \nCity Hall said Pallotta had also promised funds to help with the restoration of a fountain in front of the ancient Pantheon — now a church and formerly a Roman temple. \nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App \nShare your thoughtsSource: IndianExpress News SHARE",

      "text": "Sepp Blatter hits out at FIFA’s World Cup bidding process April 11, 2018 0 \nSwiss Blatter, FIFA president from 1998 to 2015, was also wary of the new 48-team format to be used at the 2026 World Cup. (Source: Reuters) \nFormer FIFA chief Sepp Blatter says he is shocked at a rule which has been inserted into the World Cup bidding process that could allow a five-man task force to disqualify a candidate before a democratic vote is held. \nIn 2011 the FIFA Congress, where each of the global soccer body’s 211 member associations hold one vote, was given the right to choose the World Cup hosts following a change proposed by Blatter while he was president. \nThe first hosting decision since then will be in June at the Congress in Moscow, where only two bids are in the running – a joint proposal from the United States/Canada/Mexico and one from Morocco. \nHowever, the two bids must first pass a technical inspection from a five-man task force, which has the power to disqualify a candidate whose proposal is seen as not up to scratch. \nBlatter, who was banned for six years in 2015 for unethical conduct but has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and believes he can get the suspension reversed, told Reuters that both candidates should have the right to present their bids to Congress. \nThe Swiss said he was concerned “that there is a movement” where a “special task force” will be given power “to decide who will be a candidate or not”. He added: “That is not possible.” \n“You cannot deny one of the candidates (the chance) to go to Congress. This is a principle and I stick to this principle… I was shocked.” \nBefore 2011, World Cup hosting was decided by FIFA’s executive committee, which had 24 members at the time. \nBut the previous bidding process, for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, became embroiled in allegations of illegitimate attempts to influence the committee’s voting members. \nThe finals were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively at the same time after a vote in December 2010. A subsequent FIFA investigation detailed numerous attempts to influence the voting officials but there was no suggestion the race should be re-run. \nNEW FORMAT \nSwiss Blatter, FIFA president from 1998 to 2015, was also wary of the new 48-team format to be used at the 2026 World Cup, when the tournament will be increased from 32 countries. \nThe teams will be divided into 16 groups of three in the first round, with the top two qualifying for the round of 32. One team in each group will not play on a given match day. \n“We will see what will happen with 48 teams but one thing cannot be done – to play in groups of three because we had this problem in 1982 in Spain,” Blatter said. \nIn that tournament the second round had four groups of three teams, with the winners qualifying for the semi-finals. \nThe format was never used again during Blatter’s tenure. \n“In groups of three, there is always one spectator (a team who will not be in action),” he added. \nThe 82-year-old was also wary of the video assistant referee (VAR) system which was approved by soccer’s rule-making body IFAB in March and will be used at this year’s World Cup. \n“For a purist in football as I am, I think it is an innovation which is going too fast,” said Blatter. \n“Most of the referees have never worked this system and to go the World Cup and to introduce this system in the World Cup, I think it is not very clever.” \nBlatter said that when VAR was first mooted, the idea was to give teams the right to challenge decisions, as in tennis or cricket. But under the system approved in March, the referee or the video assistant decides when to review a decision. \n“I don’t feel comfortable, definitely not, and spectators don’t feel comfortable,” he said. \nBlatter remained confident he could overturn his ban, which was imposed by FIFA’s ethics committee shortly after the Swiss attorney general’s office began criminal proceedings against him on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation. \nNo charges have yet been brought and Blatter has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. \n“So if they come to the solution (conclusion) that it is not criminal, then why, why have we been suspended?” he asked. \n“There is a possibility that this suspension will be lifted, although I don’t think it will happen before the World Cup.” (Writing by Brian Homewood, editing by Pritha Sarkar) \nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App \nShare your thoughtsSource: IndianExpress News SHARE",

      "text": "LIVE NOW auto-refresh Live Updates Commonwealth Games 2018 Day 7 in Gold Coast: England Take Lead in Final Moments News18.com | April 11, 2018, 4:28 PM IST It's Day 7 of the Commonwealth Games 2018 (CWG) being held in Australia's Gold Coast and the first medal of the day comes from shooter Om Prakash Mitharwal who bagged the Bronze in 50m Pistol Men’s Finals. India’s medal tally is now up to 23, including 11 gold, four silver and seven bronze. In another good news for the Indian contingent, boxer Mary Kom is through to the finals in the 45-48kg category and is now assured of a silver medal, her first at the Commonwealth Games. Later today, star shuttlers Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu will begin their quest for individual medals after the mixed team gold. Day 6 Highlights: Pistol shooter Heena Sidhu won big with a gold and a Games record, while para-powerlifter Sachin Chaudhary put behind a dope-tainted past to claim a surprise bronze as the Indian juggernaut slowed down a bit after five days of gold rush at the Commonwealth Games. With weightlifters through with their campaign, wrestlers yet to take off and boxers only getting into medal rounds, the number of medals were not too many to show on day six of the Games. However, India held on to their third spot in the overall tally, behind hosts Australia and England. The ranges at Belmot Shooting Centre in Brisbane were expecting to boom with strong Indian performances but it wasn't a particularly great start as Gagan Narang and Chain Singh finished outside the medal bracket in the 50m rifle prone event. However, Sidhu made up for it to an extent by shooting down the gold as well as the games record in the women's 25m pistol event. At the Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre, Chaudhary gave India their only other medal of the day in para powerlifting with an effort of 181kg in the men's heavyweight final. The medal was redemption of sorts for Chaudhary, who was banned for two years after failing a dope test in 2014. He had tested positive for the anabolic steroid methandienone and testosterone abuse in June that year. There were some strong performances in the track and field events as well with Muhammad Anas Yahiya improving his personal best and breaking the national record for a third time to finish a creditable fourth in the men's 400m final. In the women's 400m women's semifinals, the 18-year-old Hima qualified for the final with a personal best of 51.53 seconds. Apr 11, 2018 4:28 pm (IST) \nGOAL!

      "text": "Rajyavardhan Rathore Asks CGF Not To Remove Shooting From 2022 CWG Roster April 11, 2018 4 \nRajyavardhan Singh Rathore wrote to the CGF President Louise Martin © Twitter \nWith shooting set to be dropped from the Birmingham Commonwealth Games' roster, Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore on Thursday shot off a missive to his British counterpart and to the CGF President, asking them to intervene and ensure that the sport remains a part of the 2022 edition. The Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has left it to the host nation, in this case England, to keep or remove shooting, which has always been an optional sport, from the schedule. \nRathore wrote not only to the CGF President Louise Martin but also sought intervention from Britain's MP Matt Hancock, who is Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. \nRathore, himself an Olympic medal winning shooter, said removal of the sport from the CWG 2022 will create negative impact on the Indian and as well international shooters. \n\"Dropping the sport from the CWG, 2022 would come as a major setback to the large number of athletes in these countries who would be preparing for this competition and also the sport loving public who have watched and enjoyed this sport over so many Commonwealth and Olympic Games,\" Rathore wrote in his letter. \n\"I am, therefore, soliciting your kind intervention in the matter to retain Shooting as a sport in the CWG-2022, Birmingham,\" the Athens Games silver medallist in double trap wrote. \nBirmingham has expressed its reservations about putting together facilities to host shooting events. \nRathore, in his letter, explained how the popularity of the sport has grown substantially in India and that training and competition venues for shooting have mushroomed all over the country. \n\"With the recent successes of Indian shooters at the world stage, a large number of youngsters are taking up shooting as a competitive sport and aspiring for excellence at the international level. I am sure that this would be the position in a number of countries,\" Rathore wrote. \n\"If shooting is axed from the Games roster, it would come as a massive blow to India, which has done quite well in the sport,\" Rathore wrote. \nIndia is second in the CWG's all-time medal list for shooting, having won 118 medals, including 56 told, till the Gold Coast Games. \nTopics : Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore Shooting CWG 2018 India Get the latest IPL 2018 news, check IPL 2018 schedule, IPL live score & IPL Points Table.

      "text": "Tweet \nNew Delhi: With shooting set to be dropped from the Birmingham Commonwealth Games' roster, Sports Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore on 11 April shot off a missive to his British counterpart and to the CGF President, asking them to intervene and ensure that the sport remains a part of the 2022 edition. \nThe Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) has left it to the host nation, in this case England, to keep or remove shooting, which has always been an optional sport, from the schedule. File image of Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore. PTI \nRathore wrote not only to the CGF President Louise Martin but also sought intervention from Britain's MP Matt Hancock, who is Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. \nRathore, himself an Olympic medal winning shooter, said removal of the sport from the CWG 2022 will create negative impact on the Indian and as well international shooters. \n\"Dropping the sport from the CWG, 2022 would come as a major setback to the large number of athletes in these countries who would be preparing for this competition and also the sport loving public who have watched and enjoyed this sport over so many Commonwealth and Olympic Games,\" Rathore wrote in his letter. \n\"I am, therefore, soliciting your kind intervention in the matter to retain Shooting as a sport in the CWG-2022, Birmingham,\" the Athens Games silver medallist in double trap wrote. \nBirmingham has expressed its reservations about putting together facilities to host shooting events. \nRathore, in his letter, explained how the popularity of the sport has grown substantially in India and that training and competition venues for shooting have mushroomed all over the country. \n\"With the recent successes of Indian shooters at the world stage, a large number of youngsters are taking up shooting as a competitive sport and aspiring for excellence at the international level. I am sure that this would be the position in a number of countries,\" Rathore wrote. \n\"If shooting is axed from the Games roster, it would come as a massive blow to India, which has done quite well in the sport,\" Rathore wrote. \nIndia is second in the CWG's all-time medal list for shooting, having won 118 medals, including 56 told, till the Gold Coast Games. \nUpdated Date: Apr 11, 2018 21:36 PM Tags : #Britain's MP Matt Hancock #Commonwealth Games 2018 #Commonwealth Games Federation #CWG 2022 #Gold Coast Games #Louise Martin #Olympic #Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore #Shooting #SportsTracker Also See",

In fact, he took a nearly two-minute flight in the skies as a solo paraglider, becoming the first visually challenged person in India to do so. This achievement of his in the field of Paragliding has reinforced Divyanshu’s belief that any disability is insignificant if one has the right perspective towards looking at challenges in life. Apart from Paragliding he has to his credit a successful expedition to Milam Glacier in the Kumaon hills’ of Uttarakhand in the Himalayas among few others. Divyanshu, is now working towards promoting adventure sports among persons with disabilities through his social initiative ‘Adventure Beyond Barriers’. He has certified trainers to train many disabled individuals in mountaineering and trekking, paragliding and scuba diving. Kuntal Joisher -Vegan Everester Mountaineer Kuntal Joisher, a software engineer by profession stood on top of the world (Mt Everest) as the first Vegan. Joisher stood proudly on top of Everest after close to 12 hours of grueling climb. Joisher has dispelled all myths. With no altitude sickness and fit throughout his 60 days’ climb, he has shown and inspired the world that mountaineering can be done on a healthy whole foods vegan diet. He wanted to prove to the world that Vegans and Vegetarians are not weak and that if you have any dreams, including partaking n some of the toughest sport on the planet, it’s very possible to do it on a Vegan Lifestyle. Josher was initially a vegetarian born into a Gujarati family. He would then eat even cakes that had eggs and even had dairy products. The change to a complete vegan came 13 years ago when he moved to LA to study and work. He turned a vegan to take a stand for animal rights. Being Vegan is now a way of life for him. He feels very strongly about this cause and this is not going to waver anytime soon for him. This list aims to highlight people who have the greatest impact and reach in health and wellness. GOQii does not necessarily endorse the people in the list personally. The top 30 health and fitness influencers have been derived from the list of 100 names that the GOQii staffers, players and ambassadors nominated. A scoring system was created based on the following categories: Followers on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube; Number of Google news mentions; and an estimate of how much each person’s career focuses on fitness and health. This data was collected primarily throughout the month of January and February 2018. The following names have emerged as influencers who have truly created a stir in the health and fitness space.

(Source: AP) \nRoma president James Pallotta agreed to pay a fine and apologized to Mayor Virginia Raggi on Wednesday after jumping into a downtown fountain to celebrate the win over Barcelona. \nSurrounded by a crowd of flag-waving Roma fans, Pallotta performed a backward somersault in his dress shirt and pants into a fountain in the Piazza del Popolo. \nPallotta was ecstatic after Roma surprised Barcelona with a 3-0 win Tuesday to overturn a three-goal first-leg deficit in the Champions League quarterfinals. \nPallotta, a Boston executive who was part of the four-man American team that purchased Roma in 2011, is also a minority owner of the Boston Celtics. \nCity ordinances call for a 500 euro ($600) fine for wading into historic fountains. \n“We spoke and he apologized,” Raggi said. “He did it in a moment of excitement but he realizes the importance of the example he needs to provide. And clearly he’ll pay the fine.” \nPallotta was to see Raggi later Wednesday for a previously scheduled meeting. \nRoma is still seeking final approval to start construction on a new stadium inspired by the Colosseum. \nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App \nShare your thoughtsSource: IndianExpress News SHARE",

      "text": "CWG 2018: Indians Dominate On Another Good Day At The Games April 11, 2018 3 \nShreyasi Singh won gold in women's double trap event © PTI \nIndia dominated the range and the ring as Shreyasi Singh's double trap gold shored up the medal tally while the entire men's Indian boxing contingent made the semifinals to be assured of podium finishes in an unprecedented performance on day 7 of the 21st Commonwealth Games. On the overall medal tally, India held on the third position with 12 gold, four silver and eight bronze medals for a total of 24 so far. This number is expected to jump substantially once the wrestlers begin their campaign tomorrow and the boxing medals are finalised in the next two days. \nThe Belmont Shooting Centre in Brisbane continued to be a happy hunting ground for Indian shooters and for a fourth successive day the country had a medal to celebrate. Shreyasi, a silver-medallist from the 2014 edition, beat Australia's Emma Cox in a shoot-off to improve the colour of her medal from the last time. \n\"This is the highest medal of my career, right up there. It is also very special because shooting is not going to be a part of the Commonwealth Games in 2022,\" said the 26-year-old. \n\"It would be the one to cherish for a very long time,\" she added. \nThere were a couple of bronze-medallists as well in Om Mitharval (50m pistol) and Ankur Mittal (men's double trap). And some disappointment too as 10m air pistol gold-medallist Jitu Rai signed off 8th in the 50m pistol final. \nFrom the range to the Oxenford Studios and it only got better for India. All eight of the male Indian boxers entered the semifinals, while the redoubtable M C Mary Kom (48kg) entered the final. \n\"It was difficult in the sense that this girl would just not come to me. I had to be careful because she was perhaps waiting for me to let my guard down,\" Mary Kom said of her defensive opponent, Anusha Dilrukshi Koddithuwakku of Sri Lanka. \nGaurav Solanki (52kg), Vikas Krishan (75kg) and Manish Kaushik (60kg) joined Manoj Kumar (69kg), Satish kumar (+91kg), Amit Panghal (49kg), Naman Tanwar (91kg) and Mohammed Husammuddin (56kg) in the semis, making for a very happy Indian boxing contingent, shepherded by Swedish coach Santiago Nieva. \nThere was good news from the hockey arena as well with India beating England in their final pool B clash to set up a semifinal with New Zealand. The spark that had been missing so far from their campaign was rediscovered to an extent and coach Sjoerd Marijne said he could finally recognize his team again. \nOn the badminton court, the stars of the mixed team's gold medal winning campaign began their singles run and with easy opponents in opening rounds and the likes of P V Sindhu, Saina Nehwal and K Srikanth hardly took less than 20 minutes each to move into the pre-quarters. \nMost of the table tennis and squash players made their way into pre-quarters of their respective individual and doubles events. In squash, the spotlight is on defending gold medallists Joshna Chinnappa and Dipika Pallikal, who won their opening match today. \nThere was disappointment in the athletics arena where high jump hope Tejaswin Shankar ended up sixth after fouling all his attempts at 2.27m even though his personal best stands at 2.28m. \nIt's the first time I am experiencing something like this. I still have a lot of big competitions coming up this year. The biggest positive is that I could hold my nerve against these big competitors. I realised they are people like me, they are not gods, Shankar said later. \nAlso finishing sixth was Hima Das, but in the 400m women's race. She could, however, take solace from the fact that she achieved a personal best of 51.32sec. \nTopics : Other Sports CWG 2018 India Get the latest IPL 2018 news, check IPL 2018 schedule, IPL live score & IPL Points Table.

He was the chief coach during the 2012 London Olympics.",

We just have another opportunity to try our level best and win tomorrow’s game. We’re here to progress in the tournament and we can accomplish that only by winning tomorrow’s game”, Coppell stated in the pre-match press conference. \nAfter upsetting the I-League champions Minerva Punjab FC in the Round of 16, the ISL debutants have set the quarterfinal date with Goa and the English coach said that his team is physically fine and they’ll go all guns blazing. \n“We had a long time to recover from our last match and we are in a good shape physically. We’re rearing to give it a shot tomorrow.” \nCoppel further said that it’s tougher to keep the possession rather than winning it and they’ll set the strategy accordingly. \n“According to me, the easiest thing is to say keeping the possession. But I would say, it’s tougher to keep the ball with you than chasing it. The team who has the ball need to work harder to keep the possession. We’ll play to the best of our physicality and ability to perform,” he said. \nNonetheless, FC Goa who overturned ATK in their previous match, are rating their opposition highly before the match. \n“They are a very good team and a good bunch of players are there in Jamshedpur. They’re defensively very organised. But, we are also here to show our worth and what I strongly feel, we are ready for the match,” midfielder Pronay Halder said in the pre-match press conference. \nGoa assistant coach Derrick Pereira said that they have a few niggles but not major injury woes before the humdinger. \n“I can’t say that we’re missing any player tomorrow. But there a few niggles. We can the final call only tomorrow,” he said. \n“The important part is that the team have regrouped well and they’re working hard. The team is eager to put up a good performance and progress further to the semi-finals.” Share this:",

Even closer to Susanville are Antelope Lake and Crater Lake (not the one in Oregon ) both popular with folks in the area. Eagle lake is well regarded for for fishing. Lake Almanor is fantastic for swimming and water sports; rent a boat at Knotty Pine or Plumas Pines. The Bizz Johnson Trail runs along the Susan River between Susanville and Westwood - check in town for bike rentals and when the shuttle runs of you want to ride the whole thing one way (start in Westwood for a downhill ride). There is also a beautiful recreation trail along Lake Almanor's west shore - rent bikes at Bodfish in Chester. Stop in Westwood just to check it out, its an old logging town and there's not much there but its a piece of CA that most people don't know even exists.\nEdited: today, 20:33 Mentioned in this post &#xe041 &#xe002 Crater Lake 371 Reviews Crater Lake National Park, OR &#xe01a Oregon United States &#xe002 Lake Almanor 104 Reviews Chester, CA &#xe03b",

      "text": "'Shocked' Sepp Blatter hits out at FIFA's World Cup bidding process Sports Reuters Apr 11, 2018 20:39:36 IST Tweet \nZurich : Former FIFA chief Sepp Blatter says he is shocked at a rule which has been inserted into the World Cup bidding process that could allow a five-man task force to disqualify a candidate before a democratic vote is held. \nIn 2011 the FIFA Congress, where each of the global soccer body’s 211 member associations hold one vote, was given the right to choose the World Cup hosts following a change proposed by Blatter while he was president. \nThe first hosting decision since then will be in June at the Congress in Moscow, where only two bids are in the running - a joint proposal from the United States/Canada/Mexico and one from Morocco. File image of Sepp Blatter. Getty Images \nHowever, the two bids must first pass a technical inspection from a five-man task force, which has the power to disqualify a candidate whose proposal is seen as not up to scratch. \nBlatter, who was banned for six years in 2015 for unethical conduct but has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and believes he can get the suspension reversed, he told Reuters that both candidates should have the right to present their bids to Congress. \nThe Swiss said he was concerned “that there is a movement” where a “special task force” will be given power “to decide who will be a candidate or not”. He added: “That is not possible.” \n“You cannot deny one of the candidates (the chance) to go to Congress. This is a principle and I stick to this principle... I was shocked.” \nBefore 2011, World Cup hosting was decided by FIFA’s executive committee, which had 24 members at the time. \nBut the previous bidding process, for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments, became embroiled in allegations of illegitimate attempts to influence the committee’s voting members. \nThe finals were awarded to Russia and Qatar respectively at the same time after a vote in December 2010. A subsequent FIFA investigation detailed numerous attempts to influence the voting officials but there was no suggestion the race should be re-run. \nNew Format \nSwiss Blatter, FIFA president from 1998 to 2015, was also wary of the new 48-team format to be used at the 2026 World Cup, when the tournament will be increased from 32 countries. \nThe teams will be divided into 16 groups of three in the first round, with the top two qualifying for the round of 32. One team in each group will not play on a given match day. \n“We will see what will happen with 48 teams but one thing cannot be done - to play in groups of three because we had this problem in 1982 in Spain,” Blatter said. \nIn that tournament, the second round had four groups of three teams, with the winners qualifying for the semi-finals. \nThe format was never used again during Blatter’s tenure. \n“In groups of three, there is always one spectator (a team who will not be in action),” he added. \nThe 82-year-old was also wary of the video assistant referee (VAR) system which was approved by soccer’s rule-making body IFAB in March and will be used at this year’s World Cup. \n“For a purist in football as I am, I think it is an innovation which is going too fast,” said Blatter. \n“Most of the referees have never worked this system and to go the World Cup and to introduce this system in the World Cup, I think it is not very clever.” \nBlatter said that when VAR was first mooted, the idea was to give teams the right to challenge decisions, as in tennis or cricket. But under the system approved in March, the referee or the video assistant decides when to review a decision. \n“I don’t feel comfortable, definitely not, and spectators don’t feel comfortable,” he said. \nBlatter remained confident he could overturn his ban, which was imposed by FIFA’s ethics committee shortly after the Swiss attorney general’s office began criminal proceedings against him on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and misappropriation. \nNo charges have yet been brought and Blatter has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. \n“So if they come to the solution (conclusion) that it is not criminal, then why, why have we been suspended?” he asked. \n“There is a possibility that this suspension will be lifted, although I don’t think it will happen before the World Cup.” \nUpdated Date: Apr 11, 2018 20:39 PM Tags : #FIFA #FIFA World Cup #Football #KickingAround #Sepp Blatter #Sports #VAR #Video Assistant Referee #World Cup Bidding Also See",

      "text": "LIVE NOW auto-refresh Live Updates Commonwealth Games 2018 Day 7 in Gold Coast: Indian Shuttlers Win Easy in Opening Round News18.com | April 11, 2018, 2:49 PM IST It's Day 7 of the Commonwealth Games 2018 (CWG) being held in Australia's Gold Coast and the first medal of the day comes from shooter Om Prakash Mitharwal who bagged the Bronze in 50m Pistol Men’s Finals. India’s medal tally is now up to 23, including 11 gold, four silver and seven bronze. In another good news for the Indian contingent, boxer Mary Kom is through to the finals in the 45-48kg category and is now assured of a silver medal, her first at the Commonwealth Games. Later today, star shuttlers Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu will begin their quest for individual medals after the mixed team gold. Day 6 Highlights: Pistol shooter Heena Sidhu won big with a gold and a Games record, while para-powerlifter Sachin Chaudhary put behind a dope-tainted past to claim a surprise bronze as the Indian juggernaut slowed down a bit after five days of gold rush at the Commonwealth Games. With weightlifters through with their campaign, wrestlers yet to take off and boxers only getting into medal rounds, the number of medals were not too many to show on day six of the Games. However, India held on to their third spot in the overall tally, behind hosts Australia and England. The ranges at Belmot Shooting Centre in Brisbane were expecting to boom with strong Indian performances but it wasn't a particularly great start as Gagan Narang and Chain Singh finished outside the medal bracket in the 50m rifle prone event. However, Sidhu made up for it to an extent by shooting down the gold as well as the games record in the women's 25m pistol event. At the Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre, Chaudhary gave India their only other medal of the day in para powerlifting with an effort of 181kg in the men's heavyweight final. The medal was redemption of sorts for Chaudhary, who was banned for two years after failing a dope test in 2014. He had tested positive for the anabolic steroid methandienone and testosterone abuse in June that year. There were some strong performances in the track and field events as well with Muhammad Anas Yahiya improving his personal best and breaking the national record for a third time to finish a creditable fourth in the men's 400m final. In the women's 400m women's semifinals, the 18-year-old Hima qualified for the final with a personal best of 51.53 seconds.

This competition is a motivation to keep pushing the limits and working harder, she said. \nGiving a message to the youth, Apurvi said that it is important to have a goal in mind and do whatever it takes to achieve it. \nIn Jaipur for only two days, Apurvi plans to spend this time relaxing with her family and playing with her dogs.   11- ",

      "text": "IPL 2018, Rajasthan Royals vs Delhi Daredevils Live Streaming, When and Where to Watch, TV Timings IST Cricketnext Staff | Updated: April 11, 2018, 2:28 PM IST \nAjinkya Rahane. (Twitter/Rajasthan Royals) Rajasthan Royals will need to regroup quickly after a heavy loss when they face Delhi Daredevils in what will be their first IPL home game in five years at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Wednesday.The live telecast of the match will start at 8 PM on April 11(Wednesday) The match can be seen live on the Star Sports network and live streaming will be available on hotstar.com. You can also follow our live blog for ball-by-ball updates and analysis on cricketnext.com. Both Royals and Daredevils were outplayed in their opening games and will be itching to bounce back. Daredevils were severely hit by K.L. Rahul's fastest fifty against Kings XI Punjab, losing in Mohali by six wickets. Royals, on the other hand, could never cope with the bowling might of Sunrisers Hyderabad and went down by nine wickets in Hyderabad yesterday. It was a rather forgettable opening for the hosts who are making a comeback in the tournament after serving a two-year suspension. Skipper Ajinkya Rahane too would like to forget the outing where he failed with the bat, missed a sitter in slips and also gambled with batting only to see a complete rout of his team. Teams: Delhi Daredevils: Gautam Gambhir (captain), Shreyas Iyer, Sandeep Lamichhane, Manjot Kalra, Glenn Maxwell, Amit Mishra, Mohammed Shami, Chris Morris, Colin Munro, Shahbaz Nadeem, Naman Ojha, Rishabh Pant, Harshal Patel, Jason Roy, Vijay Shankar, Prithvi Shaw, Rahul Tewatia, Jayant Yadav, Abhishek Sharma, Avesh Khan, Trent Boult, Daniel Christian, Sayan Ghosh, Gurkeerat Singh Mann. Rajasthan Royals: Ajinkya Rahane (C ), Ankit Sharma, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jofra Archer, D'Arcy Short, Dushmantha Chameera, Stuart Binny, Shreyas Gopal, S Midhun, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin, Prashant Chopra, Krishnappa Gowtham, Mahipal Lomror, Jatin Saxena, Anureet Singh, Aryaman Birla, Jos Buttler, Heinrich Klaasen, Zahir Khan and Rahul Tripathi.

      "text": "Kareena interacted with the media after she received the 'Lokmat Maharashtrian Power Celebrity of the Year Award' at the Lokmat Maharastrian Of The Year award ceremony on Tuesday in Mumbai. Kareena is regarded as one of the topmost actresses of Hindi film industry over the years earning box-office success, critical acclaim and many awards. However, when asked whether she thought of foraying into other fields apart from acting, she said: After 18 years of working in this profession, I don't think I can think about anything else because I always wanted to be an actor so, I can't imagine life without acting. Sharing her feeling on receiving the award, she said, Of course, each award is important. We always get awards for our work in films but when you get awarded by your own state as 'Maharashtrian Of The Year' with so many important dignitaries getting it, then, I think it becomes very special. I am very proud of my state and city. I am a true Mumbaikar and I feel very humble to receive this honour. Kareena's 'Tashan' co-star Akshay Kumar also received 'Maharashtrian Of The Year' award at the ceremony. Speaking about him, Kareena said, I think there is no one more deserving than him (Akshay) because his choices of films are so brave. He tries to do something different in films with relevant topics. Wellknown personalities from politics, corporate, sports, Hindi and Marathi film industry, including Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and his wife Amruta Fadnavis, attended the award ceremony. Kareena will soon be seen in Shashanka Ghosh's Veere Di Wedding which will be her first film post the birth of her son Taimur. The film also stars Sonam Kapoor, Swara Bhasker and Shikha Talsania. The film is slated to release on June 1. --IANS iv/nks/in",

      "text": "LIVE NOW auto-refresh Live Updates Commonwealth Games 2018 Day 7 in Gold Coast: Saina, Srikanth Begin With Easy Wins, Sindhu in Action News18.com | April 11, 2018, 2:01 PM IST It's Day 7 of the Commonwealth Games 2018 (CWG) being held in Australia's Gold Coast and the first medal of the day comes from shooter Om Prakash Mitharwal who bagged the Bronze in 50m Pistol Men’s Finals. India’s medal tally is now up to 23, including 11 gold, four silver and seven bronze. In another good news for the Indian contingent, boxer Mary Kom is through to the finals in the 45-48kg category and is now assured of a silver medal, her first at the Commonwealth Games. Later today, star shuttlers Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu will begin their quest for individual medals after the mixed team gold. Day 6 Highlights: Pistol shooter Heena Sidhu won big with a gold and a Games record, while para-powerlifter Sachin Chaudhary put behind a dope-tainted past to claim a surprise bronze as the Indian juggernaut slowed down a bit after five days of gold rush at the Commonwealth Games. With weightlifters through with their campaign, wrestlers yet to take off and boxers only getting into medal rounds, the number of medals were not too many to show on day six of the Games. However, India held on to their third spot in the overall tally, behind hosts Australia and England. The ranges at Belmot Shooting Centre in Brisbane were expecting to boom with strong Indian performances but it wasn't a particularly great start as Gagan Narang and Chain Singh finished outside the medal bracket in the 50m rifle prone event. However, Sidhu made up for it to an extent by shooting down the gold as well as the games record in the women's 25m pistol event. At the Carrara Sports and Leisure Centre, Chaudhary gave India their only other medal of the day in para powerlifting with an effort of 181kg in the men's heavyweight final. The medal was redemption of sorts for Chaudhary, who was banned for two years after failing a dope test in 2014.

      "text": "ICC forms dispute panel on PCB’s compensation claims against BCCI April 11, 2018 4 \nThe hearing will take place at the ICC headquarters in Dubai from October 1-3. (Source: File) \nThe ICC has constituted a three-member dispute resolution committee to look into Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) USD 60 million compensation claim against the BCCI for not honouring the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), which required the two countries to play five bilateral series in an eight year cycle between 2015-2023. \nThe hearing will take place at the ICC headquarters in Dubai from October 1-3. \nPCB had appealed to ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee, accusing the BCCI of not honouring the Future Tours & Programme (FTP) commitment, which also required them to play at least two away series against Pakistan on a neutral venue like the UAE. \n“The International Cricket Council today confirmed that the Hon Michael Beloff QC will chair the Dispute Panel in the matter of proceedings between the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India,” ICC stated in a release. \n“The two other members of the panel, which has been established under the Terms of Reference of the ICC Disputes Resolution Committee, are Jan Paulsson and Dr Anabelle Benett AO, SC,” it further said. \nThe world cricket’s governing body also made it clear that decision of the Dispute Panel shall be non-appealable. \n“The hearing will take place as per article 10.4 of the Terms of Reference of the ICC Disputes Resolution Committee, the decision of the Dispute Panel shall be non-appealable and shall remain the full and final decision in relation to the matter and binding on all parties.” \nWith Indian government not allowing Indian cricket team to engage in any bilateral contest against the neighbouring nation in prevailing political circumstances, the BCCI has no option but to adhere to centre’s strict diktat. \nBCCI has not incurred any significant financial loss by not playing Pakistan. However PCB was banking on their home series against the arch rivals, to fill their coffers as most of the top international nations have not toured the country due to security reasons. \n“Our contention is pretty simple. We will play Pakistan in ICC or multi-nation tournaments like Asia Cup but can’t engage in a bilateral series until we get a go-ahead from the union government. There are certain sensitive issues that we need to take note of. It’s not that ICC is unaware of what the circumstances are. The hearing is in October and there is still some time. Let’s wait and watch,” a senior BCCI official told PTI on Wednesday. \nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App Tags:",

      "text": "Audi, the German luxury car manufacturer, has launched the second generation Audi RS 5 Coupé in India. Priced at Rs 1,10,65,000, the all-new Audi RS 5 Coupe is now available at all Audi dealerships across India.\nThe latest RS5 gets aggressive styling lines, sharp cues, with standard 19-inch wheels with 20-inches as options. On the interior, the RS5 gets a lot of performance-oriented design elements like sports seats, flat-bottomed steering wheel, Alcantara leather fittings, sports pedals, and Audi's Virtual Cockpit instrumentation with RS5 badging.\nUnder the bonnet, the RS5 will get an all-new 2.9-litre twin-turbo V6 petrol motor. The engine is a nowhere close to Audi's last-gen 4.2-litre naturally aspirated V8. The new-gen engine may have a smaller displacement, but Audi has tweaked it to produce a maximum power output of 450bhp with maximum torque of 600Nm. Audi claims a 0-100kmph time of 3.9 secs for the new RS5 with a limited top speed of 250kmph. It still remains to be seen if Audi is planning to introduce the RS5 sports coupe with the optional RS Dynamic package which takes the top speed to 280kmph, and also includes various lightweight elements like a carbon-fibre roof, and a weight loss of 60kgs, and an optional sports exhaust system.",

      "text": "Varun Aaron targets county success to overcome IPL 2018 snub April 11, 2018 0 \nAaron said he always wanted to experience county cricket and the IPL snub made his decision to head to Britain that much easier. (Source: AP) \nVarun Aaron has shrugged off the disappointment of being left unwanted at this year’s India Premier League (IPL) auction with the Indian paceman instead channelling his focus on striving for a successful county stint in England. \nDespite being overlooked by all eight IPL franchises, the 28-year-old is now armed with a deal to play for Leicestershire in the early part of the 2018 County Championship, a stint he hopes will put his stuttering career back on track. \n“I was not really thinking about whether I’d be picked or not in the IPL auction,” Aaron, who has represented the Delhi, Kolkata, Bangalore and Punjab franchises in the lucrative Twenty20 league, told Reuters in a telephone interview. \n“It was more a case of which team is going to pick me. But when it didn’t happen, it was a shocker for sure,” added the right-arm bowler, who played his last test in 2015. \n“But it took me a few minutes to snap out of it. For the amount of hard work I have put in, for all that I have come through, I feel there’s bigger things in store. When we talk after six months, then I can tell you that it’s the best thing to have happened to me. I really feel this might be the turning point,” he said, looking forward to his spell in England with the Division Two side. \nAfter the snub, Aaron set his sights on county cricket and an unlikely door opened when Leicestershire asked him to fill the ‘overseas player’ void left by Pakistan seamer Mohammad Abbas, who will be busy on national duty. \nAaron said he always wanted to experience county cricket and the IPL snub made his decision to head to Britain that much easier. \n“I even considered skipping IPL last year to play county cricket. I spoke to my colleagues and my coaches who said ‘No, you must play in the IPL, it’s a big thing in the calendar’ and stuff like that,” he said. \n“This year what happened is by default… county cricket is really competitive. I know that after I come out of this, what I’m bowling now is going to be maximised by a big margin.” \nAaron burst on to the test scene in 2011 as a genuine speed merchant in an Indian pace attack of mostly line-and-length bowlers but a spate of injuries ensured he has played only nine tests and the same number of one-day internationals. \n“I have had so many injuries. Every time I’ve hit form, something has happened,” he said. \n“Touch wood, the past year’s been really good. I’ve bowled a lot of overs in the (domestic) Ranji Trophy and getting a county deal immediately after that, it’s going to help me a lot.” \nBLESSING IN DISGUISE? With India set to tour England later this year and also head there for the 2019 World Cup, Aaron felt the IPL rebuff could actually prove to be a “blessing in disguise”. \n“While I’m not thinking about it constantly, it would be really stupid to say it’s not something I haven’t thought about,” he said. \n“At the same time, I can only play for the India team if I do well for Leicestershire. I’m really looking forward to making an impact with Leicestershire. I can still do big things. In the coming years, I definitely want to win matches for India abroad.” \nThe paceman from Jharkhand also admitted to having a better understanding of both his body and his craft, pointing to his increased workload in domestic cricket as evidence of this acquired knowledge. \n“What I’ve lacked all these years is that I have not played cricket consistently,” he added. \n“You evolve as a bowler only if you play games and bowl those overs. I can finally see that ease in my bowling and my body is now responding to my mind. I really feel this is the way forward. I really don’t just want to run the race, I want to be the best at it. That’s why even after so many injuries, I have not reduced my pace, I have not changed my work ethic. I still keep at it.” \nAaron believes he has age on his side and remains undaunted by the settled look to India’s present pace attack. \n“A lot of the great bowlers in the world have peaked after 27, be it Dennis Lillee, Dale Steyn, or (James) Anderson,” he said. \n“I think 27-28 is when you really understand your body and your bowling as a fast bowler. I feel 28 is the ideal age to bowl at your best. I’m really excited for the days ahead. Competition never bothered me. I know I’m unique and if I’m bowling at my best, I will get picked to play for the country. Back in 2013-14, it was a very settled unit. Zak (Zaheer Khan) was playing, Ishant (Sharma) was playing, Umesh (Yadav) was playing, and there was Praveen Kumar too. And I still got into the team.” \nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App Tags:",

Both Royals and Daredevils were outplayed in their opening games and will be itching to bounce back. Daredevils were severely hit by KL Rahul's fastest fifty against Kings XI Punjab, losing in Mohali by six wickets. Royals, on the other hand, could never cope with the bowling might of Sunrisers Hyderabad and went down by nine wickets in Hyderabad on Monday. Live Score Match 6, Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, Apr 11, 2018 \nRR \nDD Match yet to begin \nIt was a rather forgettable opening for the hosts who are making a comeback in the tournament after serving a two-year suspension. Skipper Anjikya Rahane too would like to forget the outing where he failed with the bat, missed a sitter in slips and also gambled with batting only to see a complete rout of his team. The comfort zone of playing at home may give the desired dose of much needed confidence but the cracks exposed against Sunrisers need to be addressed quickly. The batting order in absence of Steve Smith looked brittle, the overseas players including Ben Stokes looked shaky against the spinners. \nWhen and Where to Watch: Rajasthan Royals (RR) vs Delhi Daredevils (DD) \nIndia: TV: Star Sports 1, Star Sports 1 HD (English, Hindi, Tamil).

Audi is perceived as a young sporty brand and this model will be a main contributor to that image building,” Ansari told PTI. \nThe all new Audi RS5 Coupe has the performance of a sport scar, while providing comfort of a sedan, thus appealling to enthusiasts who love driving, he added. \nIt bridges the gap for those customers who are practical and want to own a luxury car with the performance of a sports car, Ansari said. \nThe model will be imported as a completely built unit (CBU) from Germany like other sports cars that Audi sells in India. \n“At present, volumes don’t justify assembling them here in India,” he said. \nWhen asked about plans for the year, Ansari said 2018 is the year of ‘Audi Progression’ and in line with this, the company is renewing its sports car portfolio in India. \nAudi India had reported 2 per cent increase in its total sales at 7,876 units in 2017 as against 7,720 units in the previous year.

      "text": "April 11, 2018 18:42 IST Updated: April 11, 2018 18:42 IST more-in A three-member panel will hear the claim later this year, the sport's world governing body said in a statement. \nThe International Cricket Council has created a dispute resolution panel to hear Pakistan's compensation claim against arch-rival India for refusing to play a bilateral series. \nSporting ties between the neighbours have suffered in recent years amid rising political tensions, and Pakistani cricket authorities say their counterparts have violated a 2014 memorandum of understanding under which the two were to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023. \nThe Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is seeking $70 million in compensation. It initiated dispute resolution proceedings against the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) at the ICC in November last year. \nA three-member panel will hear the claim later this year, the sport's world governing body said in a statement on Tuesday. \n“The hearing will take place in Dubai from October 1 to 3 and the decision of the Dispute Panel shall be non-appealable” and binding on both Pakistan and India, the ICC said. \nThe BCCI refused to play two series against Pakistan in 2015 and 2017, saying it did not have permission from the Indian government because of strained relations. \nIndia-Pakistan ties, including sports and cultural contacts, plummeted after the 2008 militant attacks in Mumbai, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistani militant groups. \nThere has been just one bilateral tour since, when Pakistan visited India to play two Twenty20s and three one-day internationals in December 2012 and January 2013. \nThey have, however, continued to play each other in multinational events like the World Cup.",

      "text": "April 11, 2018 / 5:36 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Uber still believes autonomous vehicles have a future, says CEO David Shepardson 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said on Wednesday that the ride-sharing company still believes in the prospects for autonomous transport after one of its self-driving vehicles was involved in a fatal crash in Arizona last month. FILE PHOTO - Dara Khosrowshahi, Chief Executive Officer of Uber Technologies, attends the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 23, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Picture \nA 49-year-old woman was killed after being hit by an Uber self-driving sports utility vehicle while walking across a street in Phoenix, leading the company to suspend testing of autonomous vehicles. \nKhosrowshahi declined to say when the company might resume testing or what might have gone wrong. He said the company was cooperating with federal investigators and dealing with the incident “very seriously.” \nThe accident has raised questions about the lack of clear safety standards for such vehicles. \nBut, speaking at a transport forum, Khosrowshahi said Uber was still betting on the technology in the long-term. \n“We believe in it,” he said, adding that Uber considered autonomous vehicles “part of the solution” and in the long-term key to eliminating individual car ownership. \n“Autonomous (vehicles) at maturity will be safer,” he said. \nThe company’s interest in investing in bike sharing and public transit should not be interpreted as a move away from self-driving cars, he added. \nThe U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the incident. \n“They are a neutral party,” said Khosrowshahi. “They understand this.” \n“We’ll figure out what we do afterwards.” \nArizona’s governor suspended Uber’s ability to test self-driving cars on public roads in the state following the crash. Arizona had been a key hub for Uber’s autonomous project, with about half of the company’s 200 self-driving cars and a staff of hundreds. \nGovernor Doug Ducey last month called a video of the incident“disturbing and alarming” and the crash “an unquestionable failure.” \nNTSB chairman Robert Sumwalt on Tuesday told Reuters he had no update on the investigation.

      "text": "IPL 2018, CSK vs KKR: Feels good to come back after two years and win in Chennai, says MS Dhoni April 11, 2018 4 \nMahendra Singh Dhoni of Chennai Super Kings bats during VIVO IPL. (Source: AP) \nChennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said it felt good to come back after two years and win at the M A Chidambaram Stadium, after beating Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL last night. \n“It feels good, to come back after two years and win. The crowd deserved the first innings, the second innings. \nEverybody has their own emotion levels, but in the dugout, we like to keep faith in our batsmen or bowler in a particular time,” he said. \n“Positive energy helps. My pulse rises too – and that’s why we have a dressing room. I express myself in the dressing room but not in the dugout,” he added, at the presentation ceremony after CSK posted a five-wicket in over KKR in its first game at home on return to IPL. \nDhoni said bowlers from both sides had a rough time but the crowd must have enjoyed. \n“If you’re too expressive in the field, then commentators get a lot of things to talk about. It’s good to see Sam bat the way he batted. Yes, we did go for runs, and Kolkata did bat well,” he said. \n“Bowlers from both sides had a rough time, but I’m sure the crowd enjoyed,” he added. \nKKR captain Dinesh Karthik said it was frustrating not to defend 202 and praised Andre Russell who blasted a blistering 88. \n“Look, CSK had great support and we were expecting that. Hats off to them. Frustrating not to defend 202, but well done to Andre,” he said. \n“These things happen in T20 cricket, so you’ve got to keep your chin up and move on. Basically, you need to know that you’ll lose some games, so it’s important to take the positives and not repeat our mistakes,” he added. \nOn his part, Sam Billings, whose superb knock of 56 helped CSK post a nail-biting win, said, “It was a pleasure to play in a team of legends – with Raina, Dhoni and Harbhajan.” \n“Mike Hussey’s batting coach as well, so need to learn as much as I can from these guys. We keep options in our head, but you have to keep three different plans in place,” he added. \n“We showed in the first game (Bravo’s blitz), that if you take the game deep, then it’s never really lost. Raina, Dhoni, Jadeja in the middle-order are big hitters. We knew no target is out of reach with this batting team,” Billings said. \nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App Tags:",

Watch April 11, 2018 0 \nMike Bushell was live with the Team England swimmers participating in Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast \nViewers watching BBC's coverage of the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday morning were left giggling after a sports reporter hilariously fell into a swimming pool on live TV in an interview gone wrong. BBC Breakfast's sports presenter Mike Bushell was preparing to interview medal-winning swimmers from Team England when he decided to get into the pool. More hands-on reporting, eh? As he stepped into the water to chat with the swimmers, who sat on the edge of the pool, the presenter – dressed in a casual, summery shirt and shorts – warned he was being careful to protect his equipment.\"I'm going to be careful because I've got a sound pack on,\" he said to the swimmers.Turns out, he wasn't very careful.As he began introducing the swimmers, the reporter took a step back. Not realising the water wasn't so shallow anymore, the reporter went straight in, along with the sound pack he was so carefully trying to safeguard.\"Sorry about that,\" the soaked presenter exclaimed as the swimmers burst out laughing.The presenter had another go, this time being careful about his step but the swimmers had a tough time keeping a straight face.The moment was shared on social media by BBC breakfast and viewers alike. BBC even reposted the clip with some clever special editing effects. \nThis, from Mike Bushell on BBC Breakfast, is the most joyous thing you will see all day. pic.twitter.com/rVphkZCOJD \n— Ryan Wilson (@rhwilson83) April 11, 2018 \nIn case you missed it… What a recovery from Mike Bushell! #MikeFallsIn#BBCBreakfastpic.twitter.com/c9OVGdtFxb \n— BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) April 11, 2018 \nAccording to The Guardian, the presenter had to stop as his microphone suffered water damage.Comments\"Mike is carrying on talking but we can't hear him, because a moment ago Mike fell in the water, his pack went in, and he doesn't know we can't hear him now,\"news presenter Charlie Stayt said from the BBC studio.It was all laughs on Twitter too. \nClassic @mikebreakfast you are brilliant, well done for carrying on.

      "text": "IPL 2018 Live Streaming, SRH vs MI Live Online Streaming: Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Mumbai Indians IPL Match Timing, Venue, TV Channel \nChennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni said it felt good to come back after two years and win at the M A Chidambaram Stadium, after beating Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL last night. \n“It feels good, to come back after two years and win. The crowd deserved the first innings, the second innings. \nEverybody has their own emotion levels, but in the dugout, we like to keep faith in our batsmen or bowler in a particular time,” he said. \n“Positive energy helps. My pulse rises too – and that’s why we have a dressing room. I express myself in the dressing room but not in the dugout,” he added, at the presentation ceremony after CSK posted a five-wicket in over KKR in its first game at home on return to IPL. \nDhoni said bowlers from both sides had a rough time but the crowd must have enjoyed. \n“If you’re too expressive in the field, then commentators get a lot of things to talk about. It’s good to see Sam bat the way he batted. Yes, we did go for runs, and Kolkata did bat well,” he said. \n“Bowlers from both sides had a rough time, but I’m sure the crowd enjoyed,” he added. \nKKR captain Dinesh Karthik said it was frustrating not to defend 202 and praised Andre Russell who blasted a blistering 88. \n“Look, CSK had great support and we were expecting that. Hats off to them. Frustrating not to defend 202, but well done to Andre,” he said. \n“These things happen in T20 cricket, so you’ve got to keep your chin up and move on. Basically, you need to know that you’ll lose some games, so it’s important to take the positives and not repeat our mistakes,” he added. \nOn his part, Sam Billings, whose superb knock of 56 helped CSK post a nail-biting win, said, “It was a pleasure to play in a team of legends – with Raina, Dhoni and Harbhajan.” \n“Mike Hussey’s batting coach as well, so need to learn as much as I can from these guys. We keep options in our head, but you have to keep three different plans in place,” he added. \n“We showed in the first game (Bravo’s blitz), that if you take the game deep, then it’s never really lost. Raina, Dhoni, Jadeja in the middle-order are big hitters. We knew no target is out of reach with this batting team,” Billings said.
