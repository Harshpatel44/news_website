      "text": "IPL 2018 Live Score Cricket, RR vs DD: Stokes Taking the Attack to Delhi Bowlers Cricketnext Staff |   8:17 PM IST Match 6, Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur 11 April, 2018 Live Now : Toss won by Delhi Daredevils (decided to bowl) TOSS NEWS: Gautam Gambhir wins the toss and Delhi will bowl first as Gambhir feels that the pitch will remain the same and there could be dew later in the evening. Rahane says toss is not in one's hand and he is happy to bat first. Same team for RR and Nadeem comes in for Mishra for DD. Maxwell comes in for Christian. 20:15(IST) \nChris Morris has now come into the attack in place of Nadeem as Delhi look to further dent the Rajasthan line-up. One wicket here for Delhi and the pressure will be on Rajasthan who hasn't got off to a good start whatsoever. Rahane and Stokes are trying to build a good partnership here. 20:13(IST) \nAnother good over from Boult as he gives away just five runs from it. Yes, there was boundary from it but other than than, there was just one single and other deliveries were dot balls. Gambhir will be happy how his bowlers have bowled thus far in the innings. 20:11(IST) \nFour: Ben Stokes has come out early and he has made his intentions clear by hitting Boult for a stunning boundary. Stokes came dancing down the track and hit the ball through the covers for a boundary. Good start for the southpaw. 20:08(IST) \nOUT: Short hit the first Nadeem delivery for a boundary, but then on the next ball he is dismissed, courtesy of a stunning peice of fielding by Vijay Shankar. After hitting the ball on the on side, the batsmen went for a double, but Shankar hit the stumps directly and afffected the run out. First blood to Delhi. 20:05(IST) \nExcellent first over from Boult to start the proceedings as he gives away just just 6 runs from it and doesn't concede a single boundary. Shahbaz Nadeem comes onto bowl now. He has come into the side in place of Amit Mishra who was taken for runs in the previous game against SRH. 20:01(IST) \nRahane and Short have made their way into the middle and Trent Boult is bowling the first over of the match. Rahane gets off the mark with a double and the onus will be on these two to score some runs early on. 19:56(IST) \nThe onus will be on Rajasthan openers Rahane and Short to provide their team with an ideal start. But at this ground, out of four matches Rajasthan has won three matches and therefore enjoy a much better head to head record. With so many batting powerhouses in their ranks, Rajasthan will look to start with a bang in front of their home ground. 19:46(IST) \nDew factor has forced Gambhir to bowl first and Rahane agreed to it during the toss. Even Rajasthan wanted to bowl first due to the dew factor which will make it difficult for bowling in the later stages of the match. 19:41(IST) \nBoth team lost their respective opening matches and will look to get back to winning ways in this clash. While Delhi will look to Glenn Maxwell, who returns after missing the first match due to personal reasons. As for Rajasthan, they are playing the same squad as last time and will look at their big money signings to fire. 19:36(IST) \nTeams: Rajasthan Royals (Playing XI): Ajinkya Rahane(c), D Arcy Short, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Jos Buttler(w), Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin Delhi Daredevils (Playing XI): Colin Munro, Gautam Gambhir(c), Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh Pant(w), Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Shahbaz Nadeem, Trent Boult, Mohammed Shami 19:35(IST) \nAt the TOSS, Gambhir: Looks a good wicket, won't change much. Perhaps dew will come in. That's why we are chasing. Just the start of the tournament, need to get the combination right. We have the full squad now. Maxi is back and we all know how dangerous he can be. Important to get the combinations right and hopefully we can do it. Two changes - Nadeem for Mishra, Maxwell for Christian. Rahane: We would have bowled as well but as I said, toss isn't in our control. We will look to bat well and put runs on the board. I think the boys have adjusted to the conditions well, especially the overseas ones. They are experienced campaigners. We are unchanged. \n19:32(IST) \nTOSS NEWS: Gautam Gambhir wins the toss and Delhi will bowl first as Gambhir feels that the pitch will remain the same and there could be dew later in the evening. Rahane says toss is not in one's hand and he is happy to bat first. Same team for RR and Nadeem comes in for Mishra for DD. Maxwell comes in for Christian. 19:25(IST) \nBanned for life from cricket activities, former Rajasthan Royals co-owner Raj Kundra on Friday said he has filed a petition in the Supreme Court after Delhi Police gave him a clean chit in the Indian Premier League betting scandal. Kundra had filed an application under Right To Information at the Delhi Police who in their reply said there's \"no evidence\" of betting charges against him. \"We have filed an application under RTI to Delhi police seeking whether there's any evidence against me on the alleged betting,\" Kundra told reporters on the sidelines of an Indian Chambers of Commerce programme. \"The answer we got against the RTI is that they have no evidence against me, and I have nothing to do with betting. The RTI is available to all of you. Even you can file an RTI and see it.\" Kundra and then ICC chief N Srinivasan's son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan were suspended from any type of cricket matches for life after they were found guilty of betting in the T20 tournament. The Supreme Court-appointed committee in its 2015 verdict had also suspended former champions Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals for two years. The two franchises will be back this season after serving two years suspensions and Kundra hoped the ban is overturned and he is back to resume duties at the Rajasthan Royals. \"I hope so (the ban is overturned). We have submitted it and I don't know the date of a hearing. It's in the courts. We all have trust in the judicial systems. Fingers crossed. In our review (petition) we have asked please see what the Delhi Police has said and the basis on which I've been banned for life. Please study the new evidence, study them and tell us if I committed any crime. Then I will accept it. If Delhi Police is clearly saying I've done 'nothing wrong, why penalise me', why I'm being victimised.\" 19:20(IST) \nNepal's cricket sensation Sandeep Lamichhane on Saturday urged the game's administrators to increase the number of teams in the World Cup and give associate nations a better chance of playing on the sport's biggest stage. Lamichhane, 17, and his teammates made history earlier this month when Nepal gained one-day international status at the World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe. The 2019 World Cup in England and Wales will have 10 teams -- including the West Indies and Afghanistan, who won their spots in tournament through the qualifiers. Lamichhane -- the first Nepalese player to land an Indian Premier League deal -- believes the International Cricket Council should give more opportunities to up-and-coming teams. \"Every player from every country dreams of playing (in) the World Cup,\" the leg-spinner told reporters in New Delhi on Saturday. \"ICC should have increased the number of teams so that every player gets a chance to play (in) the World Cup and grow their cricket to the top level.\" He has come a long way from competing against players from associate nations to playing with some of cricket's biggest stars in India's cash-rich Twenty20 tournament. The IPL's Delhi Daredevils paid $318,000 to sign him in January. Now Lamichhane, who has been likened to spin legend Shane Warne, is being coached by World Cup-winning former Australia captain Ricky Ponting. \"He is a fantastic player from his era to now and it's a precious moment to share a dressing room with him,\" Lamichhane said of the batting great. The Nepalese teenager also trained at Michael Clarke's cricket academy in Sydney after he was spotted by the former Australian skipper at the Hong Kong T20 Blitz tournament in 2016. The same year, the Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) was suspended by the ICC because of political interference by the Himalayan nation's government. Lamichhane is hopeful that his IPL stint will be the start of a new era for Nepal's cricketers. \"We were nowhere in cricket in the last two years (but) after getting ODI status recently we are getting lots of opportunities,\" he said. \"I think (the IPL) is a great opportunity for me and it will help grow our cricket back home. We want to remain... an ODI nation and we want to play Test cricket as well.\" Lamichhane added that exposure at the game's highest level will help bridge the gap between players from associate nations and cricket's powerhouses. At Delhi, he will be joined by Australian allrounder Glenn Maxwell, New Zealand pacemen Trent Boult and South Africa's Kagiso Rabada. \"Some of the balls which can't be hit by associate players, (top players) can smash them anywhere,\" Lamichhane said. The \"difference is experience, we don't get to play those big games. We don't get that kind of exposure.\" 19:14(IST) \nThe BCCI is all set to monitor workload of top 50 Indian cricketers, starting with the seven-week IPL, and will create a database for their workload and injury management to keep them fresh for big international assignments. It has been learnt that the Indian team management is keen that a big pool of players including the top internationals, fringe players and domestic performers are brought under a robust performance and fitness monitoring system in the coming years. \"Yes, the plan is there on the anvil. We want to create a database of 50 players. In those 50 players, 27 are our centrally contracted players (with Mohammed Shami re-inducted) and there will be another 23 players, who will be added to the list. These 23 players will be short-listed during the Indian Premier League,\" a senior BCCI office-bearer said. \"Starting from India's tour of UK (which includes a short tour of Ireland), the national team is going to have enormous amount of workload till 2019 World Cup in England. Those who are performing, will have their workload monitored as well as the various parameters of their fitness levels checked. If they don't attain required levels, they are not likely to be considered for India or India ‘A’ teams. Physio Patrick Farhart will monitor them at the National Cricket Academy (NCA),\" the official added. The blue-print is being prepared and the national selection committee headed by MSK Prasad will have a major role in selecting the 23 players. The BCCI earlier had also put plans in place to monitor the workload of fast bowlers during the IPL with a cap on the number of overs that each centrally contracted player would send down at the nets. With big tours of England and Australia coming up in the next nine months and the volume of ODI cricket set to increase, BCCI will need at least 7-8 fit fast bowlers, who could be rotated and kept fresh. Apart from the 27 in the list, it is expected that players such as Rishabh Pant, Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, Avesh Khan and Deepak Hooda are likely to be inducted. 19:07(IST) \nHaving recently taken over the captaincy at Rajasthan Royals from Steve Smith in the wake of the ball-tampering controversy that has rocked Australian cricket, Ajinkya Rahane believes it is important to respect the Aussie batsman’s record. Smith along with David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were banned by Cricket Australia for their roles in the ball-tampering incident in Cape Town. Smith and Bancroft incidentally were the two players who admitted to this incident after the third day’s play in the third Test against South Africa. “Whatever had to happen has happened. It’s bygone now. It is not for me to comment on the amount of penalty handed to him by the Cricket Australia and the ICC. But his cricketing record should be respected. I respect him as a batsman and player,” Rahane said during a media conference. Along with Smith, his teammate David Warner also lost his captaincy with the IPL side Sunrisers Hyderabad in the aftermath of the controversy in South Africa. The absence of both the Australian batsman means there is added responsibility for the other players according to Rahane, more so on him as the captain of the Royals. “Yes we would miss him but we have a replacement Heinrich Klaasen. I feel it is an added responsibility and also a big challenge for me,” said Rahane. Smith, Warner and Bancroft were all sent home from the South Africa series by Cricket Australia after a probe. All three players, on arrival addressed the local media in emotional press conferences and apologised for their actions. 18:59(IST) \nIt was last year that the BCCI had made it mandatory for its players to clear the yo-yo endurance test. This is a general parameter to rate the fitness of cricketers worldwide. Now with the IPL starting in a few days, some of the franchises are also making its players take the test. According to reports, four out of the eight franchises have already made their players undergo the yo-yo test in the lead-up to the event. Mumbai Indians conducted their yo-yo tests at a ground in the outskirts of Mumbai whereas other franchises who too have made it mandatory for their players to take the test are Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), Kings XI Punjab and Rajasthan Royals. It is also learnt that Sunrisers Hyderabad, Kolkata Knight Riders, Delhi Daredevils and Chennai Super Kings are yet to adopt the endurance test in their training schedules. Mumbai players were given 14.5 seconds to complete each level of the yo-yo test, starting from level 5. At RCB, players had to undergo the test as soon as they were picked in the auction, just to get their lung power tested. The reason for this is, so that the teams can design the training programmes accordingly. “The teams now want their players to match up to the standards adopted by international teams around the world. India now has made the yo-yo test mandatory, so it’s natural to see some of the IPL teams follow suit. It’s good to see where each player stands in terms of their fitness levels how much work the support staff needs to put in behind the scenes with them,” said one member of an IPL team. 18:48(IST) \nIndia batsman Shreyas Iyer feels the great Ricky Ponting's \"go for the kill\" approach can help Delhi Daredevils immensely in their quest for a maiden IPL trophy. It has been just four days since head coach Ponting joined the Daredevils and the young Indian players seemed to be in awe of the two-time World Cup winning Australia captain. Daredevils is a team that has under-performed consistently and the franchise is banking on Ponting to change the trend. The 43-year-old had earlier coached Mumbai Indians to an IPL title in 2015 and was with the team for two years. Iyer revealed how Ponting fired up the squad with his opening speech. \"It has been really good with (Ponting so far). He has been pretty aggressive. He has got that positive frame of mind. When he came in and gave a speech to all of us, it really fired us, we almost had goose bumps,\" said Iyer, who was one of the three players retained by the team ahead of the auction. The Gautam Gambhir-led squad has a good mix of experience and youth including U-19 stars Prithivi Shaw and Abhishek Sharma. \"We have a lot of youngsters in the team and they like freedom. Suddenly he came in and made us feel free,\" said Iyer. Ponting's speech pretty much focussed on winning the tournament, added Iyer. \"He said that 'we are here to win'. His frame of mind was pretty much about winning, not about the process. Normally, everybody comes in and talks a lot about process and but this guy had just one thing in his mind and that was to win,\" said the Mumbai batsman. Asked whether he brings in the typical Australian aggression with him, Iyer said: \"We can say that way. When I say aggression, he gives us freedom as well. He has asked us to play our own game. He has got his own way of preparing every youngster and though it has been just three days, we all know that we will get to learn a lot from him,\" he said. 18:40(IST) \nOn January 27, Rahul Tripathi's life changed forever. Despite having a base prize of Rs 20 Lakh, the Pune resident fetched a whopping Rs 3.4 Crores from Rajasthan Royals in the IPL auction in Bengaluru. But the 27 year old is determined not to let the recent success get to his head. \"I think the money is being taken care of by my dad. I am just happy to play as playing cricket is more important for me now,\" says Tripathi. Describing the scenes at his house on the auction day, he says: \"Yes, my parents were tracking the auction. They were happy that their son has gone to a good team. But they were like: 'Humare bete ka kya hoga, kaunse team me jayega' but eventually, they were very happy the way the auction panned out for me.​\" Last year, when Rising Pune Supergiant made the final of the IPL, Tripathi played his part to the perfection, scoring 391 runs at an impressive strike rate of 146. Numbers show hitting comes naturally to Tripathi. He had even slammed six sixes in an over in a domestic tournament, not once but twice! However, Tripathi says he had no \"particular strategy\" for slogging. \"​No particular strategy, I just prepared myself to play according to the ball. Didn't think much like 'I need to do this or that.' I just practised hard and knew what shot I wanted to play. I just concentrated on the ball better and how the ball will come onto the bat. That's it,\" said Tripathi. Tripathi had humble beginnings. The amount of money received at such a young age can affect any youngsters. But not Tripathi who is more than happy to get an opportunity to showcase his talent on a big stage. \"IPL is a great opportunity for youngsters like us to go out and play some of the finest bowlers in international cricket. I just wanted to repeat the way I played last year. So the money wasn't a big factor for me. For me, it was an opportunity to play at such a big stage and get recognised for it,\" he asserts. Like any other budding cricketer Tripathi too dreams of playing for India someday. But he knows, with the likes of KL Rahul already waiting in the wings, breaking into the current Indian team as an opener is not going to be easy. \"Yes, I am going to work hard this time. And definitely if I keep performing well, then who knows I will soon get the opportunity to represent my country,\" Tripathi added. It was Steve Smith who was his captain when he played his first game in IPL for Pune last year. When asked about the recent ball-tampering incident which has tarnished the image of former Australia captain, Tripathi refuses to opine his views. \"It's an unfortunate incident and that's all I can say about it,\" he signed-off. 18:36(IST) \nRajasthan Royals mentor Shane Warne has put his weight behind skipper Ajinkya Rahane and said that he fully believe in the capabilities of the star India batsman. \"I am happy to be back with the Rajasthan Royals and I am grateful for the great opportunity given to me. It's like coming back to home. The best squad is put together and we have the best captain in Ajinkya Rahane whom I fully trust,\" he said. \"We have few match winners with bat and the ball as well. We have great talent at our disposal and it was wonderful job done at the auction.\" Skipper Rahane said that it was another opportunity for him to learn from Warne. \"We have a great side and I am really excited for the coming season. I am looking to learn some more things from Shane Warne,\" said Rahane. Talking about the DRS system introduced for the first time in IPL, Rahane said that it would be helpful. \"DRS is being introduced for the first time in IPL and it would be helpful. I am excited regarding it but the only thing is that I will have to trust the wicket keeper and the bowler before making an appeal,\" he said. \"I feel Sanju Samson who would be keeping the wickets will have to be more watchful.\" Meanwhile, Warne also lashed out at opportunists and said that the ball tampering scandal has given a chance to the cricketing world to \"slam boot\" into Australians. He also felt that every country should take this opportunity to look into their own back yards and decide how they want to play the game. Warne, who has taken over the role of a Mentor for Rajasthan Royals, said he was disappointed and embarrassed by what happened during the third Test between Australia and South Africa in Cape Town. \"It is very disappointing but I feel that this given an opportunity to others to slam boot into Australians without any reason,\" Warner said. \"I am not defending what Smith has done and I am also embarrassed as any other Australians with the happenings. Anyone who has been beaten by Australia, who don't like the way the Australians play the game or they don't like any individual in any country have taken the opportunity to take boots into the Australians.” Warne, who had also led Rajasthan Royals to the title in the inaugural edition of the IPL in 2008, said every nation should introspect and decide how they want to play the sport. \"I think it is great opportunity for every single country look into its own backyards and think the way they want to play cricket and for what we stand for including the Australians. Otherwise this opportunity would go,\" said Warne who was the skipper of Rajasthan Royals for four seasons. 18:27(IST) \nDelhi Daredevils have been one of the most underachieving IPL sides over the past few years, finishing in the bottom-half of the table in the last three seasons. This year, Daredevils have turned to local city boy Gautam Gambhir, who they let go in 2011 and he joined Kolkata Knight Riders, helping them win two titles under his captaincy. Gautam Gambhir last played for DD in IPL 2010. He has scored 1097 out of his 4132 IPL runs (26.55%) with Delhi. He is one of two skippers to have captained more than 100+ IPL games. Gambhir has led his team 123 times, while Dhoni has led his 143 times. 60%: Gambhir’s win rate as skipper of DD (9 wins in 15 matches): the best by any player to have skippered the franchise 10 or more times. He is also one among 3 captains to win multiple IPL titles. Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni are the two others to have done the same. He is the 3rd highest run getter against KXIP in the IPL scoring 671 runs in 21 matches against them. He has a strike rate of 125.18 and a balls/boundary rate of 5.96. He has scored 6 half centuries against KXIP. Only Chris Gayle (797 runs) and Suresh Raina (683 runs) have scored more against KXIP in the IPL. Delhi Daredevils head coach Ricky Ponting has exuded optimism and said that he doesn't care about his team's dismal record over 10 editions of IPL as he believes that the \"fresh group\" of players have it in them to win a maiden title this season. 18:20(IST) \nKings XI Punjab started off their IPL campaign in style as they registered a comfortable 6-wicket win against Delhi Daredevils in Mohali. After being set a target of 167, KL Rahul got Punjab to a blistering start as he smashed fastest fifty in IPL history, in just 14 balls. When Rahul was batting Punjab was cruising at 52/0 in three overs, with the other opener—Mayank Agarwal batting at 2. The right-hander eventually got out at 51 after hitting six fours and four sixes. But after Rahul’s departure, Punjab lost its way somewhat, as they lost one more wicket quickly, and their run-rate dropped drastically. Yuvraj Singh, who came in at no. 3, couldn’t really produce the desired performance as he could only score 12 runs from 22 balls. After Yuvraj’s departure, Karun Nair (50) and David Miller (24) did the damage control and took the team to a safe position. Nair started slowly, but picked up his scoring rate once he got his eye in. The match was finished well by Marcus Stoinis who smacked 22 runs from 15 balls. It was a disappointing show by Delhi bowlers, as they could not control the flow of boundaries in the innings. Mohamed Shami gave away 26 runs from his two overs, while Amit Mishra leaked 46 runs in his 4 overs. Though Dan Christian and Rahul Tewatia bowled well but that didn’t prove enough. Earlier in the day, after choosing to bowl first, Kings XI Punjab did well to restrict Delhi to just 166 runs in their allotted 20 overs. It was due to skipper Gautam Gambhir’s 42-ball 55, that Delhi could post that kind of total. Gambhir’s innings involved five fours and one six, but the team could not continue the momentum he gave them. After his departure, there were quick-fire innings from the bat of Rishabh Pant (28) and Chris Morris (27), but that was never going to be enough, seeing the strong batting line-up of Punjab. It would be fair to say Delhi could have managed a better total, if not for an unpredictable batting order. Delhi sent in Vijay Shankar before the hard-hitting Pant, and an unknown Rahul Tewatia before all-rounder Chris Morris. One of the problems that came to the fore for Delhi was that they couldn’t string big partnerships in the middle of the innings, and kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Their highest partnership of the day came between Gambhir and Shreyas Iyer, who stitched 42 runs together. As far as Punjab’s bowling is concerned, the match marked a dream debut for Afghanistan youngster Mujeeb Ur Rahman. The 17-year-old, who became the youngest cricketer ever to play in the IPL, returned with figures of 2/28 in his four overs. Ravichandran Ashwin, in his first match as skipper did well and bagged one wicket conceding 23 runs only. The lanky spinner bowled some of his leg-spinners too, that were a difficult to pick for the batsmen. He somewhat managed to put brakes on the scoring rate, after pacer Andrew Tye and Axar Patel gave 38 and 35 runs, respectively. 18:18(IST) \nRajasthan Royals captain Ajinkya Rahane has lamented the team's failure to build a single partnership of note following their loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League (IPL). The Sunisers restricted RR to 125/9 and chased down the target with nine wickets and 25 balls to spare. \"We thought on this wicket, 150-160 would have been ideal total because ball was doing the bit and medium pacers got good help. But, we didn't get that one partnership. I think we lost crucial wickets in between. Partnership was the key in between,\" Rahane said at the post-match press conference late last night. Observing that it is just the beginning of the tournament, he expressed confidence that the team would give its best in the coming matches. Replying to a query, he said the team's overseas players, including Ben Stokes, Jos Butler and D'Arcy Short, are very competent players. \"I think foreigners who played, they are really good. D'Arcy Short, he did really well in Big Bash, did well for Australia recently, Joss Butler and Stokes, we all know how dangerous they are and Ben Laughlin is an experienced bowler in T20 cricket,\" he said. Australia's Steve Smith stepped down as captain in the wake of the ball tampering row, and Rajasthan are now focused on achieving success with the available resources in hand. \"Definitely, Steve Smith is a quality player. We are not thinking about him right now. It's all about how we can contribute.\" He appreciated Sunrisers bowlers Siddharth Kaul and Billy Stanlake for their performance. \"He (Kaul) bowled well. I think him, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Stanlake, three of them they bowled really well. I think Siddharth Kaul, he changed his pace really well. He was bowling, hitting the length hard and that was the key aspect\" he said. 18:07(IST) \nHello and welcome to the LIVE coverage of the game between Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Daredevils. Smarting from a crushing defeat at the hands of Sunrisers Hyderabad in their opening fixture, Rajasthan Royals will look to seek home comfort and register a win when they take on Delhi Daredevils, who lost against Kings XI Punjab, in an Indian Premier League (IPL) clash here on Wednesday. Back at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium after serving a two-year ban, Rajasthan, under spin legend Shane Warne, had nothing going their way against Hyderabad. Royals huffed and puffed to 125/9 after being asked to bat, and then saw Hyderabad canter home with nine wickets in hand. Sanju Samson was the only shining light for the inaugural champions with a watchful 42-ball 49 as star batsman and skipper Ajinkya Rahane fell for 13 and only Rahul Tripathi (17) and Shreyas Gopal (18) managed to reach double figures. The second wicket did stand for 46 runs while the fourth-wicket stand stitched together 29 off just 13 deliveries. Both the partnerships could have shaped the innings well but failed miserably. \"Getting a good start in the first six overs, that was the key, and we got that,\" Rahane had said after the match. \"Six overs and we were close to 50 with one wicket down. But we lost crucial wickets in the middle overs. \"I always believed that it was a wicket where one big partnership or (if) one set batsman can bat through the innings that really would've helped.\" Hyderabad bowlers proved to be hot for Rajasthan and what made matters worse was how their bowlers meekly surrended in the face of Shikhar Dhawan's 57-ball 78. Against Delhi, the hosts will need to improve on every count. What would go in their favour is that their opponents also come into the game having not done well against Kings XI Punjab in their opener. Newly appointed captain Gautam Gambhir (55) led from the front but lacked support around him. Delhi's batting is not that strong either with lack of experieneced names effecting the middle order. Lokesh Rahul's 16-ball 55 -- fastest IPL fifty -- made matters worse for them but a cause of worry for Delhi is seamer Mohammed Shami going for a lot of runs as Delhi will want him to deliver alongwith New Zealand pacer Trent Boult. Delhi will start as favourites against Rajasthan but unlike their first match if the likes of in-form D'Arcy Short, Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler or Ben Laughlin fire on the morrow, it could well be Rajasthan's field day at home as all the players have reputation of turning the game around. \nBen Stokes (BCCI Photo) LATEST UPDATES: Gautam Gambhir wins the toss and Delhi will bowl first as Gambhir feels that the pitch will remain the same and there could be dew later in the evening. Rahane says toss is not in one's hand and he is happy to bat first. PREVIEW RR vs DD: Rajasthan Royals will need to regroup quickly after a heavy loss when they face Delhi Daredevils in what will be their first IPL home game in five years at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Wednesday. The live telecast of the match will start at 8 PM on April 11(Wednesday) The match can be seen live on the Star Sports network and live streaming will be available on hotstar.com. You can also follow our live blog for ball-by-ball updates and analysis on cricketnext.com. Both Royals and Daredevils were outplayed in their opening games and will be itching to bounce back. Daredevils were severely hit by K.L. Rahul's fastest fifty against Kings XI Punjab, losing in Mohali by six wickets. Royals, on the other hand, could never cope with the bowling might of Sunrisers Hyderabad and went down by nine wickets in Hyderabad. It was a rather forgettable opening for the hosts who are making a comeback in the tournament after serving a two-year suspension. Skipper Ajinkya Rahane too would like to forget the outing where he failed with the bat, missed a sitter in slips and also gambled with batting only to see a complete rout of his team. The comfort zone of playing at home may give the desired dose of much needed confidence but the cracks exposed against Sunrisers need to be addressed quickly. The batting order in absence of Steve Smith looked brittle, the overseas players including Ben Stokes looked shaky against the spinners and the bowlers lost heart once the batsmen could put only 125 on the board. Barring a 49 by Sanju Samson, none of other the batsmen showed any confidence nor they could build any partnerships. The shrewd cricketing brain and mentor of the side, legendary Shane Warne, will have to lift the morale of the side and he might use the success stories of home ground to motivate his men. The hosts have the resources with experienced overseas players and local talent under a calm and cool Rahane but they need to get their act together. They face Daredevils who are still in shock and feel that despite doing all good, it was just Rahul's lightning fifty which took the match away from them. The skipper Gautam Gambhir looked good and determined during his 55 and Rishabh Pant and Morris too contributed. They also have a good and experienced bowling side with Boult, Md. Shami, Morris and Amit Mishra in the forefront. The biggest factor for the Delhi Daredevils is the presence of Gambhir as skipper. He is eager to prove his prowess and leads the side with aggression. The weather in the Pink City has been cloudy with a little bit of drizzle. “We were hit hard by the RCA ban. Despite financial crunch we maintained the wicket and the outfield. There has not been much cricket on it but we have tried hard to sustain grass on it because it is this ingrown grass which binds the soil of the wicket. It is not the 200 run kind of wicket but 160-170 would be achievable because ball would come nicely on to the bat. The bowlers would also have something for them. They might find good bounce out of this surface,” said veteran curator Taposh Chatterjee. Playing XI: Delhi Daredevils: Colin Munro, Gautam Gambhir(c), Shreyas Iyer, Glenn Maxwell, Rishabh Pant(w), Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia, Chris Morris, Shahbaz Nadeem, Trent Boult, Mohammed Shami Rajasthan Royals: Ajinkya Rahane(c), D Arcy Short, Sanju Samson, Ben Stokes, Rahul Tripathi, Jos Buttler(w), Krishnappa Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal, Dhawal Kulkarni, Jaydev Unadkat, Ben Laughlin",

      "text": "Digital transformation to add US$154 billion to India’s GDP by 2021   11 Apr 2018 \nBy 2021, digital transformation will add an estimated US$154 billion to India’s GDP, and increase the growth rate by 1.0% annually, according to a new business study released today. The research, “Unlocking the Economic Impact of Digital Transformation in Asia Pacific ”, was produced by Microsoft in partnership with IDC Asia/Pacific. The study predicts a dramatic acceleration in the pace of digital transformation across India and Asia Pacific’s economies. In 2017, about 4% of India’s GDP was derived from digital products and services created directly through the use of digital technologies, such as mobility, cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI). Anant Maheshwari, President, Microsoft India said “India is clearly on the digital transformation fast track. Within the next four years, it is estimated that nearly 60% of India’s GDP will have a strong connection to the digital transformation trends”. “Organizations are increasingly deploying emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and that will accelerate digital transformation led growth even further.” The survey conducted with 1,560 business decision makers in mid and large-sized organizations across 15 economies in the region highlights the rapid impact and widespread disruption that digital transformation is having on traditional business models. The study identified five key benefits from digital transformation. According to the research findings, organizations are seeing significant and tangible improvements from their digital transformation efforts across these benefits in the range of 11% to 14% today. Business leaders expect to see more than 40% improvements in those key areas by 2020, with the biggest jump expected in productivity, customer advocacy as well as profit margin. Digital Leaders in India to Gain Lion’s Share of Economic Opportunities The study indicates that while 90% of organizations in India are in the midst of their digital transformation journey, only 7% in the entire region can be classified as Leaders. These are organizations that have full or progressing digital transformation strategies, with at least a third of their revenue derived from digital products and services. In addition, these companies are seeing between 20 -30%improvements in benefits across various business areas from their initiatives. The study indicates that Leaders experience double the benefits of Followers, and these improvements will be more pronounced by 2020. Almost half of Leaders (48%) have a full digital transformation strategy in place. Adds Sangita Reddy, Joint Managing Director, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd ., one of India’s Leaders in Digital Transformation, “Apollo Hospitals recognized the potential of technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics in providing high quality preventive healthcare services, very early on. With data being generated at an exponential proportion, technology is helping us derive insights to predict and suggest preventive steps with utmost accuracy. Our partnership with Microsoft bring us to the forefront of this remarkable metamorphosis that is allowing us to meet healthcare demand and maintain service excellence regardless of geography.” The Study identified key differences between Leaders and Followers, which contribute to the improvements tracked:• Leaders are more concerned about competitors and emergence of disruptive technologies: The digital economy has also given rise to new types of competitors, as well as emerging technologies such as AI that have contributed to the disruption of business models• Business agility and culture of innovation are key goals: When addressing business concerns, Leaders are focused on creating a culture of agility and innovation to counter competition. Followers, on the other hand, are more focused on improving employee productivity and profitability.• Measuring digital transformation successes: Organizations across Asia Pacific are starting to adopt new key performance indicators (KPI) to better measure their digital transformation initiatives, such as effectiveness of processes, data as a capital and customer advocacy in the form of Net Promoter Score (NPS). As organizations realize the potential of data as the new oil for the digital economy, Leaders are much more focused on leveraging data to grow revenue and productivity, and to transform business models.• Leaders are more aware of challenges in their digital transformation journeys: In addition to skills and cybersecurity threats as key challenges, Leaders have also identified the need to bolster their data capabilities through the use of advanced analytics to develop actionable insights in fast-moving markets.“There is a pressing need for organizations to fully capitalize on the potential value of digital transformation in the next few years. To do so, organizations need to invest in building their ecosystem, from employees, to customers, to partners, across their value chain by gaining new insights through new data sources, and incorporating digitization in their products and services, said Anil Bhansali, Managing Director, Microsoft India (R&D) .“Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help organizations in India to succeed in their digital transformation journeys today through our agile platforms and solutions that prioritize flexibility, integration and trust. We understand what organizations will need to make their journeys a successful one”, he added. Riding the Wave of Digital Transformation Organizations in Asia Pacific need to accelerate their digital transformation journey to reap the full benefits of their initiatives, and to address the invisible revolution brought about the mass adoption of AI. More importantly, companies need to focus on capitalizing their own data in order to gain new market insights, create new digital products and services, and monetize data through data sharing securely, and in collaboration with its ecosystem. Microsoft recommends organizations to adopt the following strategies to become a digital transformation Leader: 1. Create a digital culture : An organization need to build a culture of collaboration where it is connected across business functions, and has a vibrant and mature ecosystem of customers and partners. Data can then be embraced across organization and functions, where better decisions can be made and ultimately serving the needs of customers and partners better. \n2. Build an information ecosystem: In a digital world, organizations are capture more volumes of data internally and externally. The key to becoming a Leader is for organizations to be able to convert data into capital assets, and enable data sharing and collaboration internally and externally in an open yet trusted manner. In addition, a proper data strategy will allow businesses to start their AI initiatives to identify connections, insights and trends. \n3. Embrace micro-revolutions: In most cases, digital transformation efforts do not start with widespread change, but a series of micro-revolutions. These are small, quick projects that deliver positive business outcomes and accrue to a bigger and bolder digital transformation initiatives. \n4. Develop Future Ready Skills for Individuals and Organizations: Organizations today must relook at training and reskilling its workforce so that workers are equipped with future ready skill sets such as complex problem solving, critical thinking and creativity for the digital economy. More importantly, they need to rebalance the workforce to attain and attract key digital talents, as well as be open in creating a flexible work source model where they tap into skills-based marketplace. From a digital skills perspective, LinkedIn’s latest study outlines the ABCs of digital talents required for future economies in the region – artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing. In India, the top in-demand skills are big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. “The pace of digital transformation is accelerating, and IDC expects that by 2021, at least 60% of India’s GDP will be derived from digital products and services, with growth in every industry driven by digitally enhanced offerings, operations and relationships. The study shows Leaders seeing double the benefits of Followers, with improvements in productivity, cost reductions, and customer advocacy. To remain competitive, organizations must establish new metrics, realign organization structures, and re-architect their technology platform,\" said Daniel-Zoe Jimenez, Research Director Digital Transformation Practice Lead, IDC Asia/Pacific .

      "title": "Is YouTube Censoring Free Media?",
      "text": "When YouTube first emerged as a platform for video sharing, it was an unassuming website with a handful of people posting home-made videos. Thirteen years later, it’s one of the biggest video sharing platforms in the world, hosting thousands of content creators, with about 300 hours of video being uploaded every minute, as of December 2016.\nHowever, over the years YouTube’s methods of regulating content has been met with constant criticism. Their attempts to make the videos shown more appealing to ad agencies has left many YouTubers with the short end of the stick – having to alter their content based on a changing algorithm while simultaneously having to maintain the integrity of their channels.\nWhat’s Different Now? Source: Vox.com The recent shootings at the YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, has opened the ongoing discussion about YouTube’s censorship policies to the wider public. One of the main reasons for the shooter’s violent behavior seems to be her anger towards these policies which she felt were unjustly taking away from her ad revenue and viewer count.\nWhile her actions are in no way justified, the shooter isn’t the first person to express her dissatisfaction with YouTube, though she is the first to do so in such a violent manner. Major YouTubers like PewDiePie , h3h3productions , and Casey Neistat have repeatedly called attention to the website’s actions in the past.\nThe Adpocalypse According to motherboard.vice.com , YouTube has always faced issues with its content, starting from 2006 when “the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers, and Publishers successfully issued DMCA takedown requests for more than 30,000 pieces of content. Shortly thereafter, Comedy Central filed a complaint for copyright infringement, resulting in the removal of its content from the platform.” Since then, YouTube has been struggling to keep its content accessible to a worldwide audience.\nMany of the recent changes can be directly traced back to the infamous ‘ YouTube Adpocalypse ’ which began around March 2017. Advertisers started pulling out of YouTube as it was reported that their ads were being played over extremist and racist content. Several major brands pulled out, resulting in YouTube facing a massive loss, and content creators seeing a sharp decline in their revenue.\nFrom a business perspective, YouTube – and by extension, it’s owner Google – have to look out for their own interests. Advertisers provide YouTube with a majority of their revenue and having them leave the platform is a massive risk to their income. This means that YouTube needs to have videos that are of a certain style, entertaining, and inoffensive. They have also increased the recommended watch time to ten minutes, which allows more ads to play on the videos.\nYouTube devised a self-learning algorithm to filter the content coming in, and instead of there being only two categories for a video (monetized or demonetized), they introduced a third category, which meant that the video could only earn a limited amount of money from the video as it was not entirely ‘advertiser-friendly’. These videos have the option of being appealed if the creator feels they have been wrongly categorized. The video will then be reviewed by an employee to see if these claims are accurate and then decide if they should remonetize the video or leave it as is.\nHank Green – Source: USNews.com In Hank Green’s video about the adpocalypse, he mentions the two things that YouTube has that no other platform does: it has a massive audience, and it has figured out a system for creators to make money off the website. This ensures the longevity of the website, because as of right now, there is nowhere else creators can go that can promote their videos the way YouTube does which also offers to be a source of income.\nAs a response to the adpocalypse, YouTube tightened its algorithm to remove videos that were not regarded as ‘family-friendly’, but this led to several channels being caught in the algorithm that did not have inciting or offensive content. As YouTube was a source of income for several of them, they suffered a major loss during this period.\nCasey Neistat – Source: gofundme.com/LoveArmyLasVegas Creators were also incensed when they found out that YouTube favoured TV shows and creators that garnered a lot of activity on their channel. A notable incident occurred when YouTuber Casey Neistat wanted to raise money in aid of the shooting that occurred in Las Vegas. The money that Casey was going to make off that video was going to go to charity, but YouTube demonetized it as running ads on videos about tragedies was against their policy. However, the video that was uploaded on talk show host Jimmy Kimmel’s channel talking about the shooting ran ads and was even on top of the trending page. This showed a clear partiality towards bigger companies that garnered a bigger media interest. While this works in favour of the company’s revenue, it deals a heavy blow on individual content creators that are not backed by giant companies.\nAnother recent move by YouTube was to make sure creators had over a thousand subscribers or over four thousand hours of watch time in the past twelve months to enable them for ad payments. Several smaller channels considered this an attack on their livelihood, as it’s not easy garnering that many subscribers. YouTube, on the other hand, said that this would discourage unsavoury channels from producing content and would filter out the channels that are only in it for the money. People with the drive and passion to create would continue making videos regardless and would eventually reach that milestone. While this seems like an honourable move on the part of YouTube, how it affects smaller creators remains to be seen.\nSo What Now? Looking at it from the point of view of a massive company like Google, there is an urgent need to secure a stable source of income. YouTube is a massive platform that is constantly pushed forward because of its creators, but as it is a free platform, they need to find some way to make it sustainable. Currently, the way they are achieving that is by collaborating with advertisers. However, this is starting to have adverse effects on the content being produced, as advertisers are starting to have more and more power over what videos are promoted on the platform.\nIs advertising the only way for YouTube to gain an income? That question is up for debate, as partnership with advertisers came up during the age of radio and television, when it was necessary to have sponsors to fund a show. That’s no longer necessary in this world of digital media and free content. YouTube is not television. That’s one of the things that makes it unique and interesting. It is also unlike other streaming services like Netflix or Amazon Prime that required prepaid subscriptions.\nYouTube is not television, but with regards to advertising, it is being treated as if it is. This relationship with advertisers is a hangover from a different age, an age which modern services are no longer a part of. Treating it with the same rules from a different time is to constrict it to policies that are no longer relevant.\nIs advertising the only way to go, or should YouTube spread out and find a different source of income for its content-driven creators?",

One of the rapists was called from Meerut to “satisfy his lust”. The girl was confined using sedatives, then strangled and hit on the head twice with a stone — “in order to make sure” she was dead. But not before another accused, a police personnel, asked the others to “wait because he wanted to rape” her one last time.And all this, to “dislodge” a group of Bakherwal Muslim nomads from Rasana village in Kathua near Jammu.These are just some of the chilling details in 18-page chargesheet filed Monday by J&K Police’s Crime Branch against the 8 accused in the rape and murder of the girl who went missing from near her house in Rasana on Jan.10 — her body was found 7 days later in the forests nearby.In the days that followed, the chargesheet states, the accused paid Rs 1.5 lakh as a bribe to local policemen who knew where the girl was kept and helped cover up the crime initially.The killing had sparked outrage across J&K with Govt   handing over the case to the Crime Branch following protests from the Bakherwal community. The case took a communal turn in Kathua, where an outfit called Hindu Ekta Manch was set up by politicians in support of the accused. Among those who backed the Manch were Lal Singh and Chander Prakash Ganga, 2 BJP ministers in CM Mehbooba Mufti’s Cabinet.According to chargesheet, the mastermind behind the rape and murder is retired revenue official Sanji Ram who is among the eight arrested, along with his son Vishal Jangotra and nephew, believed to be a juvenile. Crime Branch had also arrested SPOs Deepak Khajuria and Surinder Kumar, a Rasana resident Parvesh Kumar, Assistant Sub Inspector Anand Dutta and Head Constable Tilak Raj in the case. Dutta and Raj were arrested on charges of attempting to destroy evidence.According to the chargesheet, the girl’s father Mohd Yousuf lodged a complaint on Jan12 at Hiranagar station that his daughter who “had gone for grazing horses in the nearby forest at about 1230 hrs on Jan.10” had not returned. A FIR was lodged and police arrested Ram’s nephew, leading to allegations of a cover-up by Bakherwal community. On Jan.22, the case was transferred to Crime Branch.The chargesheet states that Ram masterminded the conspiracy to kidnap and, later rape and kill the girl. It states that he made SPO Khajuria and the juvenile a “part of the conspiracy and assigned them tasks separately and individually”.indianexpress Kathua chargesheet reveals gory details of how 8-year-old was raped, bludgeoned https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kathua-chargesheet-reveals-gory-details-of-how-8-yr-old-was-raped-bludgeoned/story-UNKVij0yKD6FGWbGSdgu9O.html Kathua rape, murder case was a plot to dislodge Muslim Bakarwal community: J&K Police chargesheet https://scroll.in/article/875143/kathua-rape-murder-case-was-a-plot-to-dislodge-muslim-bakarwal-community-j-k-police-chargesheet Raped, sedated, raped 'one last time': Chilling details from Kathua chargesheet https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/raped-sedated-raped-one-last-time-chilling-details-from-kathua-chargesheet-1209875-2018-04-11 Omar on Kathua rape-murder: ‘Act against on BJP ministers who emboldened lawyers’ http://indianexpress.com/article/india/omar-on-kathua-rape-murder-act-against-on-bjp-ministers-who-emboldened-lawyers-5132358/ Srinagar: Hours after J&K Police registered a case against lawyers who tried to prevent Crime Branch officials from filing a chargesheet in the Kathua rape and murder case, National Conference working president Omar Abdullah said that lawyers got emboldened by actions of two ministers in PDP-BJP coalition Govt   in the state and asked the Govt   whether action will be taken against them.NC also demanded transfer of the case from Kathua to any other court for a free and fair trial in the backdrop of lawyers’ protests.indianexpress Unnao alleged rape: BJP MLA holds grip on village, so girl who alleged rape has to hide http://indianexpress.com/article/india/uttar-pradesh-bjp-mla-kuldeep-singh-sengar-holds-grip-on-village-so-girl-who-alleged-rape-has-to-hide-5132286/ Unnao:The uproar over the death in custody of the father of a 17-year-old girl who alleged she had been raped by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar saw UP police arrest Atul Singh, the MLA’s brother. On Tuesday, he became the fifth person to be held — and sent to judicial custody — in connection with the brutal assault on the girl’s father that led to his death early Monday. Police also promised to question MLA as part of their probe.But such is the clout of Sengar and his family, so complete their grip on the village of Makhi, barely 15 km from Unnao, that the girl and her family have refused to return home, saying they fear for their lives.“Following a request made by the victim’s family, I have arranged accommodation for them in Unnao,”DM said.Girl’s mother, who was waiting at the residence of DM, said: “We will not return to the village until the situation is normal. MLA and his associates must be planning something. No one in the village will dare support us. No one will raise his voice against MLA and his family. They hold all administrative posts in the village.”MLA’s wife, Sangeeta Singh Sengar, is Unnao zila panchayat head while Atul Singh’s wife Archana Singh is village pradhan. indianexpress Unnao rape case: SIT probe only about custodial death, not gangrape https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/unnao-rape-case-sit-probe-only-about-custodial-death-not-gangrape SIT of UP   Police has begun investigating Unnao rape case, and the custodial death of the rape victim’s father.

The board has a week to produce the signatures of the emperor who died in 1666, almost 18 years after the monument he built in the memory of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal, was completed.Hearing a 2010 appeal filed by the ASI, the court directed the board to produce documents in support of its claim that none other than Shah Jahan declared the Taj a wakf property.“Who in India will believe it belongs to the wakf board? These kind of issues must not waste the time of the Supreme Court,” a bench led by CJI Dipak Misra told the board.Wakf is an endowment of land or property by a Muslim for a religious, educational or charitable purpose.In 2010, ASI had petitioned the court against the wakf board’s July 2005 decision ordering that the Taj be registered as the latter’s property. There is a stay on the order.Appearing for the board, senior advocate VV Giri said Shah Jahan executed a wakfnama in favour of the board, a submission challenged by ASI. “Then you show us the original deed executed by Shah Jahan. Show us the signature,” the bench shot back, granting a week’s time on Giri’s request.CJI Misra, however, had a few questions for the board.“How did he (Shah Jahan) sign the wakfnama? He was in jail and used to view the monument while in custody,” the country’s top judge said.The bench also reminded the board that 17th century monument and other heritage structures built by the Mughals passed on to the British after the end of the Mughal rule. After Independence, the monuments vested with Govt   and were being managed by ASI. ASI advocate ADN Rao said there was no wakfnama.

CBI has claimed that Prajapati was abducted along with Sohrabuddin and his wife Kausarbi from a luxury bus on Nov.23, 2005 by policemen from Gujarat while they were on way to Sangli from Hyderabad. Sohrabuddin was killed in a staged encounter on Nov.26, 2005 in Gujarat, subsequent to which, Kausarbi was also killed. Prajapati, a witness to the abduction, was killed on Dec.26, 2006, also in a staged encounter, the agency had alleged.The witnesses on Tuesday contradicted CBI’s case that the three were abducted at the same time from the bus by alleging that Prajapati was then at their home. CBI had maintained that Prajapati was present in the bus on Nov.23 before his arrest 6 days later.Special Public Prosecutor BP Raju, however, did not declare the two witnesses hostile.On Tuesday, a father-son duo from Rajasthan, deposed as prosecution witnesses 68 and 69. The father told the court that he had built a house in Bhilwara in Rajasthan in 2004, where he lived along with his wife and 2 sons. In 2005, he was transferred to Udaipur and while he relocated, he visited his family every few weeks in Bhilwara.He added that in March 2005, one room in their house was let out to a man claiming to be Samir Prajapati, who started a vegetable business there. “In November 2005… it was the end of the month, I received a call in Udaipur from my wife. She said that Samir has been arrested and that his real na-me was Tulsiram. The police told her that he was wanted for murder,” witness told the court. Son, who was present at the time of Prajapati’s arrest in Bhilwara in 2005, told the court that towards the end of Nov.2005,Prajapati was residing at their home. Defense advocate Wahab Khan asked the witness, “Was Prajapati at home for over 15 days?” witness promptly replied in the positive.

In his suicide note, the farmer has mentioned the debt and wrote, “I am committing suicide due to the loan burden and Modi Govt   is responsible for my suicide.”50-year-old farmer Shankar Bhaurao Chayare, a father of three daughters, swallowed pesticide in his village Rajuwadi of Ghantanji taluka, Yavatmal. According to reports, Chayare first tried to hang himself but could not succeed in doing so, then he swallowed pesticide to give up his life.

In Sept.2017, a farmer named Prakash Mangaonkar committed suicide after writing “Modi Sarkar” and “Suicide of Debt” on 2 leaves which were found along his dead body. Chayare urged state’s CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir for looking after his family member.Following his death, villagers under alleged leadership of activist Devanand Pawar surrounded the Ghatanji Police Station and raised demand to file an FIR against Narendra Modi. The protestors refused the post-mortem of deceased Chayare until the case is registered.Pawar told Indian Express, “The villagers are determined not to allow post-mortem till the offense is registered. A case of at least abetment to suicide can be immediately registered since the farmer has nearly named Modi to be the man, who has forced him to commit suicide.

So, each time we are made to divide ourselves in all sorts of way—along cast, gender, community, ethnicity, language,” said Roy during the first state congress of the Civil Liberties Committee – Telangana on Saturday, according to TOI.She was addressing a session called ‘Hindu fascism and democratic rights’. She also came down heavily on the BJP’s demonetisation move and termed it as “an act of fascism, of a kind that has never been done before ever, anywhere”. TOI reports that the activist author also termed Aadhaar as a new form of surveillance and spoke about how “every individual of a whole nation” is being controlled by this new form of surveillance.

He said the Govt   is in the process of “setting up a committee” to discuss adopting NCERT over the state board.Speaking at the first NITI Aayog meet for the Northeast, Deb said he wants quality education and not quantity, considering Tripura’s literacy ratio of 95 % , which is among the country’s highest. In his speech at the Northeast forum, Deb emphasised the importance of “education for all and health for all.”BJP swept Tripura polls last month and ended 25 years of Communist rule in the state winning 43 of 59 seats.“When I say education, I mean quality education and not just numbers.Communists only wanted the people of Tripura to study Mao (Zedong) and forget our Hindu kings. They removed Mahatma Gandhi from textbooks in Govt -run schools. I am going to implement NCERT syllabus in all these schools which will also have chapters on Tripura’s history,” he said.According to Deb, textbooks of Class IX-XII in Tripura featured the Russian and French revolutions, while some had pages devoted to the birth of cricket in England, Nazism and the rise of Adolf Hitler.“Students were being taught Karl Marx and Hitler but nothing about Indian freedom fighters,” he said. Officials also said that references to Rani Laxmibai and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose were also absent from textbooks as were chapters on the Constitution.indianexpress India’s membership to NSG: Delhi works on Beijing to drop objections on n-club entry http://indianexpress.com/article/india/indias-membership-to-nsg-delhi-works-on-beijing-to-drop-objections-on-nuclear-suppliers-group-club-entry-5132252/ New Delhi:Emboldened by its entry into three of the four multilateral export control regimes over the last two years, India on Tuesday once again reached out to China and tried to convince the interlocutors in Beijing to lift their objections at Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).

According to police, the clashes spread on Monday after pictures of the injured went viral on social media. In the wake of these rumours, an autorickshaw was set ablaze by some unidentified people at around 11pm in the Rangikhari point area, police said.In the last two days, the entire town has come down as clashes broke out in different parts of the Assam.

Reports said there had been cases of stone pelting in the past too, but the situation became worst on Sunday night, which eventually took a shape of a brutal clash. It all happened in the area, barely 700 metres from the Silchar Police station, close to the Barak river.According to a report in HT, more than 10 people were severely injured in Sunday’s clashes.

While the authorities and members of both the communities had a peace meeting, the local media also tried to lower the heat saying that the messages on social media are just a political agenda and urged people to stop reacting on such messages.NewsX My comparison between Burka and Trishul was ill-chosen, chastisement I received for it is merited: guha http://caravandaily.com/portal/my-comparison-between-burka-and-trishul-was-ill-chosen-chastisement-i-received-for-it-is-merited-ramchandra-guha/ New Delhi: More than two weeks after his article Liberals, sadly wherein he had compared Burka with Trishul created a storm in the media and social media and he received perhaps harshest criticism of his life, not by just common people, but also by academicians, writers and scholars, historian Ramchandra Guha on Tuesday admitted that “My comparison (between Burka and Trishul) was ill-chosen, and chastisement I received for it is merited.”In his new article Burdens of the past, published on 10th April in the same The Indian Express where his last controversial article was published on 24th March, Guha says: “…I have caused controversy by terming the burka “reactionary” and “antediluvian”, and by comparing (not equating) it to the trishul. Apart from (at last count) 14 responses in this newspaper, there has been an array of critical commentary in social media and in other newspapers and websites.”“My comparison was ill-chosen, and the chastisement I received for it is merited. I also agree that the headscarf and the skull-cap are akin to the turban and the vibhooti, markers of religious identity that should not offend anyone when displayed in public,” he writes.In the 24th March article, Guha had written: “Many people, this writer among them, object to Hindus flaunting saffron robes and trishuls at rallies. While a burka may not be a weapon, in a symbolic sense it is akin to a trishul. It represents the most reactionary, antediluvian aspects of the faith. To object to its display in public is a mark not of intolerance, but of liberalism and emancipation.”In the new article, after admitting his comparison between Burka and Trishul was ill-chosen, Guha, however, wrote that he agrees entirely with Dr BR Ambedkar that “the burka is a mark of suppression, of women from men, and also of separation, of Muslims from non-Muslims. If you hide your face from me, how can we be partners in a shared political project? The burka is deeply inimical to fraternity, a quality that Ambedkar emphasised was vital to the creation of a democratic society.”Caravan Daily Adani’s Jharkhand Plant an Attempt to Prop up Struggling Australia Project: Report https://thewire.in/energy/adanis-godda-plant-an-attempt-to-prop-up-struggling-australia-project-report New Delhi: Adani Group’s Godda power project in Jharkhand may be a “financially unviable prop” due to the high price of Australian coal that it plans to use and the fact that its electricity will be too expensive for Bangladesh – which intends to buy power from the project under a long-term contract – according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a well-known US-based energy research body.The initial pact signed by the two sides apparently allows project developer Adani Power to pass on full fuel cost to electricity buyer (Bangladesh).Significantly, Adani’s mega power plant in Mundra, Gujarat too has become unviable due to the high cost of imported coal. After the Supreme Court rejected compensatory tariff for the project last year, the plant’s enterprise value has fallen drastically, rendering the investment dud. Adani group plans to ship coal from its Australian mine to fire the 1,600 MW Godda project in Jharkhand, which is currently under implementation. According to the IEEFA report, the delivered cost of coal supply for the project is estimated at $90-100 a tonne, which is on the higher side for the Indian power market.More crucially, the Godda power proposal appears to be an attempt by the Adani Group to prop up its struggling Carmichael coal project in Australia, while locking Bangladesh into an expensive, long-term and emissions-intensive source of electricity for decades to come, says the report.thewire Zuckerberg’s Facebook will do “everything” to ensure “fair polls” in India https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/international/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-will-do-everything-to-ensure-fair-polls-in-india Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said that the social networking giant would “do everything possible” to ensure fair polling in India and other countries, amid widespread allegations over the company’s alleged role in influencing the American presidential vote in 2016.

At least 230 people have died over that period.The figures compiled by the Guardian, which include an average of more than one death a week in 2017, are likely to be a substantial underestimate, as no part of the UK govt records homeless death statistics at a national level, and local authorities are not required to count rough sleeper deaths.According to the Guardian’s figures, the average age of a rough sleeper at death was 43, nearly half the UK life expectancy. Around 90% of those who died in the last 5 years were men, when the gender was provided.Experts have put the rise down to a rapidly increasing homeless population, rising rents, welfare cuts and lack of social housing, and have called for the Govt   to take urgent action to address the root causes of poverty.theguardian Adulterated alcohol kills 82 in Indonesia http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/adulterated-alcohol-kills-82-in-indonesia-118041101002_1.html Indonesian authorities said on Wednesday that the number of people dead from consuming homemade adulterated alcohol on Java island has increased to 82 and seven suspects have been arrested in relation to the incident.Deputy Chief of National Police Muhammad Syafruddin said in a Jakarta press conference that 51 people died in West Java province since Friday when the affected were taken to hospitals, Efe news reported.The other 31 dead were from the metropolitan area of the provincial capital Bandung, according to Jakarta police spokesperson Argo Yuwono.IANS Trump: US-Qatar ties 'work extremely well' https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/trump-qatar-ties-work-extremely-180410135820276.html                                  US President Donald Trump has praised his country's ties with Qatar as he welcomed the Qatari emir to the White House for talks on a number of issues, including the months-long Gulf diplomatic crisis.Speaking to reporters alongside Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Trump said on Tuesday that the US and Qatar \"have been great friends in so many ways\" and \"are working very well together\".\"We are working on unity in that part of the Middle East and I think it's working out very well; there are lot of good things happening,\" added the US president.aljazeera FLASH : VIEWS & NEWS Israel has killed Palestinian child every three days for 18 yrs, reveals shocking statistic https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20180407-israel-has-killed-a-palestinian-child-every-three-days-for-18-years-reveals-shocking-statistic/ Kutch, Kathua and Unnao: Crimes against women rising under BJP?Priyanka Chaturvedi http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kutch-kathua-and-unnao-crimes-against-women-rising-under-bjp-5133088/ Why does BJP say ‘Beti Bachao’ and then do ‘Balatkari Bachao’ – over and over again?KAVITA KRISHNAN https://theprint.in/opinion/why-does-bjp-say-beti-bachao-and-then-do-balatkari-bachao-over-and-over-again/48905/ Kathua and Unnao: Handling of these two rapes makes a mockery of Nirbhaya protests:HARNIDH KAUR https://theprint.in/opinion/kathua-and-unnao-handling-of-these-two-rapes-makes-a-mockery-of-nirbhaya-protests/48565/ Bihar: Silence in NDA after attack on Minister Upendra Kushwaha: SOROOR AHMED https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/strange-silence-in-nda-after-attack-on-union-minister-upendra-kushwaha-rlsp-chief \nCompiled and edited by Anwarulhaq (Released at: 8:27 PM ) \n",

      "text": "Bengaluru leads office space demand in Q1 New Delhi, Apr 11 \nOffice space leasing rose by 25 per cent during January-March in top eight cities to 10.8 million sq ft compared to year-ago period on increased demand from corporates, bucking the trend of low absorption in the first quarter, property consultant CBRE said today. \nDuring January-March quarter of 2017, office space leasing stood at 8.6 million sq ft in eight cities -- NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Kolkata and Kochi. \nIn its latest report for January-March quarter of 2018, CBRE said that close to 11 million sq ft of space take-up was recorded - a 25 per cent increase from Q1 2017. This is a departure from the norm as the first quarter of the year usually witnesses subdued activity because corporates are still finalising their business strategies“. \nLeasing activity \nOffice leasing activity across India’s top 8 markets was at an all-time high in the first quarter of the year. \nBengaluru witnessed office space leasing of 4.8 million sq ft in Q1 of 2018, compared to 2.2 million sq ft in the same period of last year. NCR and Mumbai recorded office space leasing of 1.9 million sq ft and 1.4 million sq ft, respectively. \nTech corporates led office space take-up during the quarter with a 25% share, while BFSI firms garnered a 24% share. The share of e-commerce firms rose to 15%, thanks to a few large-sized deals by leading global and domestic players. \nOther sectors that contributed to leasing activity were engineering and manufacturing, research, consulting and analytics and co-working/business centre operators. \nPre-commitments continue to be the primary mode of transaction, especially in cities such as Bangalore that had a dearth of quality ready-to- move-in supply. \nDomestic occupiers \n“India’s office market has begun the year on a strong note, dispelling fears of technology and other disruptions impacting the market. With strong economic fundamentals, constantly improving business environment, and the government’s concerted efforts to improve infrastructure in our cities, India’s attractiveness as a preferred market in the region for international and domestic occupiers has only grown,” said Anshuman Magazine, Chairman, India and South East Asia, CBRE said. \nIndia offers quality offices spaces at reasonable rentals, he added. \nCommenting on the findings of the report, Ram Chandnani, MD Advisory & Transaction Services, India, CBRE South Asia, said: “Over the past several quarters, pre-commitments by occupiers in under-construction projects has impacted leasing activity across India’s office market. Constrained supply of ready-to-move-in space, coupled with rising rentals, has led to this trend gaining traction in recent months.” \nThe uptick in leasing activity in the first quarter is largely due to several projects getting completed. \nDuring the quarter, 45% of all the transactions were for small-sized spaces, while mid-sized transactions accounted for a 42% share. There were a few large-sized deals, most of which were recorded in Bangalore, followed by a few in Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Chennai and Hyderabad. Published on",

      "title": "Mobile Market Is Always Unpredictable: Mukaddas Shaikh",
      "text": "Email Print \nB Swaminathan \nUjjain: Ujjain based Imran mobile store is nearing 15 years in the mobile industry. Cell IT manages to interact with Mukaddas Shaikh, who owns the store in the region to know more about the market challenges and the way ahead. Edited Excerpts of his interaction. \nTell us a brief about your business? \nWe deal with all mobile and telcom products. Our wide range of products include mobiles and tablets. We are a multi brand showroom serving the customers wide range of mobiles and tablets of all renowned national and international brands such as OPPO, Apple, Gionee, Sony, Samsung, Vivo, XOLO, Google, Honor, HTC, Huawei and more. Our target audience include both the young and the old. \nIn these years what the customers view towards mobile-phone had changed? \nEarlier, we the dealers played the role of a trusted advisor in a purchase decision. We have to educate them from the scratch. However, thanks to the increase in the internet adoption, any customer comes with basic idea and primary level of research. Our role is to provide secondary research or provide the updated inputs including the latest tech details and comparison with other brands which they might not get online. \nWhat are the top three challenges in a market like Ujjain? I will not tell online has not become our threat ambit. It is still a threat which cannot be ignored by any retailer. The demands from the customers are changing. The trust which they used to have earlier is not these days. The customer still thinks that a retailer tried to make sky-high margins and push one particular brand. It is sad that many vendors who focus on the sale forget it is the service of the brand that will decide the fate. Some unethical retailers might not be bothered about the service. However, geniune retailers have to consider the burden of providing valuable service for the customers. For the customer, it is the retailer who is the primary contact when it comes to service. Poor services of many brands costed us in losing many valuable customer. \nWhat are the overall trends where the sale of mobile phone is happening? \nI can say the sale is happening around in and around INR 5 thousand price factors. I will not tell price is the only factor that is determinating. However, 80% of the sale is happening on the price factor and only 20% might get convinced by the other aspects. On the brand-wise, both Indian and global brand with excellent hardware practices are making the success of the brands. \nWhat is your organization plans? \nWe are open for any brands to partner with us to get into the Ujjain market. We ensure their reach with the right customer through our regular marcom activities and in-store activities. \nHow you see the global brands coming offline? \nThis again proves that no brand can get fulfilled ignoring physical retail stores. Another thing to cherish is that the difference between online and offline rates are thinner. \nWhat is your prediction for the mobile market this financial year? \nIn the current situation, we will not be in a position to predict the market. The prediction that was there in the last financial year is not happening now. Thus we are not in a position to predict anything.",

Ananya is one of two newcomers – the other being Disney India star Tara Sutaria – in a cast headlined by Tiger Shroff. The class of 2018 was Twitter's top trend soon after the announcement and while some tweets grumbled about 'nepotism rocks' (they are just repeating what you said, Karan Johar), the Internet appears to be largely impressed with the upcoming actress. Ananya is the elder of Chunky and Bhavana Panday's two daughters. Her sister Rysa is 13-years-old. And despite the muttered comments about her Bollywood connections, Ananya has been given a warm reception. \"She is very pretty,\" read one comment while another user added: \"She is gorgeous and very stylish.\" \nFinally joining the brat pack, presenting – @ananyapanday!

      "text": "Tweet \nMumbai: Former eight-time national champion and veteran paddler Kamlesh Mehta feels that the triumph by the Indian table tennis teams in the Commonwealth Games in Australia would give belief to young players that they too can be champions. \nIndia swept the table tennis team events of the Commonwealth Games as the men matched the women to nail a memorable gold with an emphatic 3-0 win over Nigeria in the final. File image of Kamlesh Mehta. Twitter/@UltTableTennis \nAfter Manika Batra fired India to a historic 3-1 triumph over Singapore, the Sharath Kamal-led men's outfit too beat the team from the city state 3-2 in the semifinals before beating Nigeria in the final. \n\"Absolutely, it's a dream come true. It's an unthinkable and fantastic performance and I would rate it as the golden performance of the Indian team,\" 57-year-old Mumbai-born Mehta told PTI . \nIt is the first time since the racquet sport's induction into the Commonwealth Games programme that India has topped both the categories. \n\"This is certainly going to be a trend-setting performance on two counts - one is winning the gold in both the events for the first time and two it will give the belief in each and every young player of India in table tennis that he/she can also be world-beaters. That is a bigger thing I look (at),\" Mehta added. \nMehta conceded he did not expect the women's team to beat Singapore, and termed this feat as fantastic. \n\"(In) men's, we knew we had a good chance to win the gold while in the women's we knew we will be among the medals, but winning over Singapore is not something we (expected). It was a fantastic achievement with Singapore being a strong team,\" he said. \nMehta is associated with the Ultimate Table Tennis League, which started last year. \nAsked to co-relate UTT and India's performance, he said, \"It would be unfair on my part to say that, but what reaction I have got from people (players), their coaches and their parents, is that this (UTT) played a very important role\". \n 54  54 PM",

      "text": "Anil Urs T+ T- Bengaluru, April 11 \nBengaluru continued to lead leasing activity across India in the first quarter (Q1) of the year 2018, registering a quarter on quarter (q-o-q) growth of 50 per cent, said CBRE South Asia. \nIn its latest India Office MarketView, CBRE said during the review period (Q1), the market also witnessed significant supply addition, a sign of long-term growth of the market and its continued attractiveness to domestic and foreign corporates. \nOuter Ring Road (ORR) and the Central Business District dominated leasing activity and was primarily concentrated in non-SEZ developments. As has been the trend, a majority of this absorption was the culmination of pre-commitments. \nLeasing activity was primarily driven by BFSI corporates followed by e-commerce, research, consulting and analytics and tech firms. Co-working/business centre operators continued to be active in the city. \nDuring the review period, leasing activity across India’s top eight markets was at an all-time high. Close to 11 million square feet of space take-up was recorded—a 25 per cent increase from Q1 2017. This is a departure from the norm as the Q1 of the year usually witnesses subdued activity because corporates are still finalizing their business strategies. During the January to March period, Bangalore reported the highest demand for office space and accounted for more than the combined share of the markets of Delhi–NCR, Mumbai and Hyderabad. \nIn the Delhi-NCR region, Gurgaon dominated leasing activity.New supply consisted of a few medium-sized non-IT developments in Gurgaon and an SEZ development along the Noida Expressway. Leasing activity was primarily driven by the tech sector, followed by corporates from the research, consulting and analytics, and BFSI sectors, the report said. \nThe the quarterly leasing activity in Mumbai witnessed an uptick. More than half of the leasing activity was in the Secondary Business District (SBD) and the Peripheral Business District (PBD) of Powai and Vikhroli. The report pointed out that BFSI firms and co-working operators dominated leasing activity, followed by firms from infrastructure, real estate and logistics. It also showed that Rental values remained stable during the quarter. \nAfter robust activity last year, the city of Hyderabad witnessed a marginal decline in leasing activity during the quarter, the report says. Supply addition was limited to one medium-sized development in the extended IT corridor. Tech firms, followed by engineering and manufacturing and healthcare firms, dominated leasing activity in Hyderabad. Rental values increased across all micro-markets, thanks to continued occupier interest and shortage of new supply. \nIn Chennai, transaction activity was led by small-sized deals, mainly by corporates looking to consolidate/ relocate operations. The report showed that the leasing activity declined marginally while supply witnessed an uptick in this period. However, tech corporates continued to lead demand in the city. Rents in the city increased by about 5-7 per cent in IT buildings in OMR Zone I, due to low vacancies and sustained corporate interest. \nPune saw an increase in supply addition while leasing activity declined marginally. Tech firms continued to dominate space take-up, followed by engineering and manufacturing companies. PBD accounted for more than half of the city’s leasing activity during the review period Select micro-markets in the city witnessed quarterly rental growth. \nQuarterly leasing activity and new supply addition declined marginally in Kolkata. However, rentals remained stable across all micro-markets. Demand was largely driven by occupiers from the engineering & manufacturing, and telecommunication sectors, followed by BFSI and co-working firms.Kochi witnessed a marginal increase in leasing activity. Rentals remained stable during the quarter and the demand was driven by tech firms, the study said. \nRam Chandnani, Managing Director, Advisory & Transaction Services, India, CBRE South Asia said, “Over the past several quarters, pre-commitments by occupiers in under-construction projects have impacted leasing activity across India’s office market. Constrained supply of ready-to-move-in space, coupled with rising rentals, has led to this trend gaining traction in recent months.” “The uptick in leasing activity in the first quarter is largely due to several projects getting completed,” he said. \n“Going forward, as corporate continue to evaluate cost-effective options and stagger their expansion plans, pre-commitments in under-construction projects will have a significant impact on office leasing activity across key cities,” he added.

      "text": "April 11, 7929   Prabhudas Lilladher (PL) PL 2.0 -Digital Transformation Prabhudas Lilladher (PL) PL 2.0 -Digital Transformation Posted by Nisha on April 11, 2018 Prabhudas Lilladher (PL) organised their National Progress Partner Meet (2018) on April 7 , 2018, at Mumbai. The theme for the event was PL 2.0 – Digital Transformation. The event was attended by over 300 of PL’s Progress Partners (franchisees) and specially invited guests from across India. Luminaries of the business world like Shri. Govind Dholakia (Founder & Chairman, SRK Group) presented in special segment ‘Real story of a Real Life Hero’ & Mr. Sunil Singhania (Ex-Global Head Equities – Reliance Capital) on ‘Markets – Pain and Gain’, had a lasting impact on the audience through their memorable talks. The Panel Discussion – “Vichaar Vimarsh – Making Sense of The Markets” – had an esteemed panel with Mr. Sunil Singhania, Mr. Arnob Mondal (Chief Investor Relations Officer, Larsen and Toubro ) , Mr. Jitendra Punjabi (earlier Global Strategist with Capital International Group & Founder, EM Advisors), Mr. Akshay Gupta (Group Exec Head Indiabulls & CEO Asset Management), Mr. Dilip Bhat (Jt MD, PL), Ms. Amisha Vora (Jt MD, PL) & Mr. Ajay Bodke (CEO & Chief Portfolio Manager, PL PMS). A few points & quotes from the Panel Discussion: 1) The panel felt that earnings growth will return after a wait of many quarters and Indian corporate profitability is at a decade low at 3.8% of GDP and that the markets have tailwinds though global volatility and election results will create situations now and then. 2) As regards to key trends or themes going forward, Ms. Amisha Vora said, “Consumption will continue to be a key theme in markets to select stocks for investments.” 3) Speaking about returns from the market, and contrary to popular opinion, Mr.Ajay Bodke opined, “ I do not believe markets will not give good returns in FY19 as at a price earnings ratio of 17 times, markets are not at any significant premium to the 10 year average premium to MSCI valuation.” 4) On the rise of the speciality chemicals industry, Mr. Sunil Singhania said “ Because China started focusing on pollution, the speciality chemical industry is doing well, focusing on the niche area.” 5) On the monetary policy, Mr. Jitendra Punjabi said “ A tightening of monetary policy across the globe need not result in slowing down of economies”. 6) Infrastructure expert Mr. Arnob Mondal of Larsen & Toubro noted that “ In the infra sector, the cut-throat pricing and competition of the earlier cycle is not there this time and weaker players are getting weeded out.” 7) Asked about the midcap situation in the markets, Amisha Vora commented, “A lot of sanity will come back in terms of valuations. Post GST reforms the transition in favour of organised players from unorganised players will continue.” 8) Mr. Dilip Bhat commented on mid-caps saying, “ There is good potential among some mid-caps owing to improved corporate governance.” 9) On the DII Flows Mr.Akshay Gupta said “ SIP flows will continue to come in and the markets may be relatively tough in 2018, opportunistic flows will dry out.” Earlier in the day, Ms. Amisha Vora launched PL’s new investor education initiative “PL Academy” , along with well known trainer , Mr.Ronak Moondra, who took the audience through an extremely hands on session on how to profit in the markets with the aid of sophisticated decision support tools available on PL’s Mobile App. The PL Academy is focused on internal training cum certification programmes that are targeted at substantially enhancing the ability of PL’s Progress Partners and employees alike. The modules in the academy focus on areas like financial planning, soft skills and financial markets /instruments. Ms. Amisha Vora also launched innovative tools for business management, available online as well as mobile, to allow PL Partners to offer segment specific advice to its client base. The event culminated with the Progress Partner Awards Ceremony where the top performing Progress Partners (Sub-brokers/ Authorised Persons) were honoured.",

      "text": "  PR \nAs the prom dress buying season starts to peak, Occasion Brands, LLC, releases this issue of Pulse of Prom with the 2018 early prom season’s online sales trends for both junior and senior proms in the United States. Senior prom sales continue to reign supreme at 57% of total prom dress sales, with junior prom sales not far behind at 43%. As mid-season approaches, the junior prom sales have increased by 1% in the first two weeks of March. This shows that customers start shopping early for senior prom; whereas, junior prom dresses are purchased later in the season. Among these sales, national preferences are increasingly uniform. Affordable, classic styles with “stand-out” design features made in chiffon and tulle are driving early prom dress sales. Top color choices this year are shades of red or mauve. \nTop-Selling Prom Dresses National, Not Regional \nWith the influence of social media and the connections shoppers make online, the prom dress sales trends are becoming more consistent nationwide, as opposed to showing the local or regionally specific trends seen in the past. Out of thousands of dresses available online for prom, the same three dress styles are nationally the top three sellers for both junior and senior prom this season. These three dresses consistently rank in the top 5 for proms across all regions. Specifically, they are the top 3 for the Northeast, Midwest, and Pacific (Alaska and Hawaii). These popular dress styles make it clear that the top trends and style preferences are universal this year. \nAffordability Drives Sales \nAffordability continues to drive dress sales online for early prom season. Average price paid for a prom dress consistently falls between $100-$200 at this point in the prom dress buying season, with 42% of all junior prom sales and 41% of senior prom sales falling in this same range. The top ten most popular dress styles selling in each region reflect this price range preference, while consumers in the Midwest and Pacific regions are spending just slightly more for senior and junior prom with the top ten styles in the $150-$200 and $150-$250 price ranges, respectively. \nStand-Out Design Features on Classic Styles Prevail \nThe top 10 prom dresses coveted nationally continue to be long, v-neck, and slightly a-line styles with minimal beading, sequins or embellishments. This shows a clear preference for simple and classic styling. However, each of the top selling dresses features one “stand out” element that differentiates it from the other styles. Double slits, embroidered-illusion bodices, and exaggerated high-low side slits are a few examples of the “stand out” features on popular styles. These provide a modern twist to otherwise classic looks. \nChiffon and Tulle Predominate \nFabric preferences nationally show that chiffon dominates this prom season. The majority of the top styles sold feature long, flowing chiffon skirts in a soft a-line shape. Tulle-mesh, also cut in floor-length a-line styles, is a close second. In the Northeast, West, and especially the Pacific, soft, curve-hugging jersey is beginning to make an appearance among the top ten prom dress styles sold. \nBold Red and Subtle Mauve Hold Sway \nSolid colors continue to prevail nationally. Bold red and burgundy are the top color picks for prom dress sales for the early prom season. In the Midwest, West, and Pacific, shades of red represent at least half of the top ten styles chosen by customers for prom. Mauve is beginning to make an appearance, especially in the Pacific region where three of the top ten styles sold are in this soft hue. Neutral tones, along with navy, black, and teal, round out the preferred color picks in the top ten prom dress styles nationally. \nThe Data \nThe data for these early season prom trends represents sales between January 1 and March 19, 2018 across the United States by PromGirl, a leading national online prom retailer. 2018-04-11",

      "text": "In draft rules, govt scraps ban on sale of cattle for slaughter \nIt is the first time since the racquet sport's induction into the Commonwealth Games programme that India has topped both the categories. \n\"This is certainly going to be a trend-setting performance on two counts - one is winning the gold in both the events for the first time and two it will give the belief in each and every young player of India in table tennis that he/she can also be world-beaters. That is a bigger thing I look (at),\" Mehta added. \nMehta conceded he did not expect the women's team to beat Singapore, and termed this feat as fantastic. \n\"(In) men's, we knew we had a good chance to win the gold while in the women's we knew we will be among the medals, but winning over Singapore is not something we (expected). It was a fantastic achievement with Singapore being a strong team,\" he said. \nMehta is associated with the Ultimate Table Tennis League, which started last year. Asked to co-relate UTT and India's performance, he said, \"It would be unfair on my part to say that, but what reaction I have got from people (players), their coaches and their parents, is that this (UTT) played a very important role\".",

      "text": "New Delhi: FMCG major ITC is eyeing 10 to 12 per cent market share in the packed juices and fruit beverages segment by next year as the company bets on its not from concentrate' range of juices, said a top company official.\nITC would continue to add more flavours in B Natural's portfolio and plans to add 4-5 new variants in next few months. Besides, the Kolkata-headquarted company is also looking to tap the export market.\n\"We believe that we should get double-digit market share of the juices by next year,\" ITC Divisional Chief Executive, Foods Division Hemant Malik told .\nAccording to the company, B Natural is a Rs 100-crore brand at present, and is growing 25 per cent annually. ITC has around 7 per cent share in the juices and fruit beverages market, which is estimated to be around Rs 2,500 crore.\nThe market is growing 13 to 14 per cent annually and is dominated by players like Pepsico 's Tropicana and Dabur's Real, the company said.\nAs per its strategy, ITC has now shifted away from making juices from concentrates, which are mostly imported, and is now leveraging strength of its agri division to directly source fruits from farmers and convert pulps into juices.\n\"This will lead to sourcing of over 2.5 lakh tonnes of fresh fruits directly from Indian farmers annually instead of importing concentrates,\" said Malik.\nGlobally, the trend is moving towards not-from-concentrate based juices, and in markets as US, it is sold at 30 per cent premium, he added.\n\"We have 13 products and now our entire range would be made not from concentrate and fruits sourced from the domestic market,\" said Malik.\nIt is also strengthening the distribution network of B Natural and would focus on small tier III markets, which have also started consuming packed juices, besides tier I & II places.\n\"We are using our distribution strength to expand availability across both rural and urban markets,\" he said.\nBesides ITC has also started exporting B Natural to Middle East targeting the Indian diaspora and is looking at markets as US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\nThe company is also spending on branding and promotions substantially, he said, without disclosing the numbers.",

      "text": "Mark Zuckerberg defends certain type of censorship on Facebook News PTI   3:21 PM IST \nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg today defended certain kind of censorship to remove terrorist propaganda after a US lawmaker expressed concern over the social media giant’s “pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.” Top Republican Senator Ted Cruz cited the 2016 controversy over how Facebook editors handled conservative-leaning political news in the trending topics feature. \n“I think that you would probably agree that we should remove terrorist propaganda from the service. So that, I agree, I think it is clearly bad activity that we want to get down. And were generally proud of how well we do with that,” Zuckerberg told the US lawmakers during a US Congressional hearing. \nZuckerberg was testifying before the US Congress amid a firestorm over the Cambridge Analytica data leak. \nIn March, it was found that British firm Cambridge Analytica tied to US President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign improperly collected profile data of up to 87 million Facebook users. \nHe said he was “very committed” to ensure that Facebook was a platform for all ideas. \n“That is a very important founding principle of what we do. We’re proud of the discourse and the different ideas that people can share on the service, and that is something that, as long as I’m running the company, I’m going to be committed to making sure is the case,” he asserted. \nTo a great many Americans that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias. Do you agree with that assessment? Cruz asked. \nZuckerberg said, I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook in the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place, and this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we do not have any bias in the work that we do, and I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about. \nFacebook, he said, do not generally ask people about their political orientation when they’re joining the company. \n“Mr. Zuckerberg, do you feel its your responsibility to assess users, whether they are good and positive connections or ones that those 15 to 20,000 people deem unacceptable or deplorable? Cruz asked. \nSenator, I think that there are a number of things that we would all agree are clearly bad. Foreign interference in our elections, terrorism, self-harm, Zuckerberg said. \nThis is published unedited from the PTI feed. Published Date: April 11, 2018 3:21 PM IST",

      "text": "Digital transformation contribute usd 154 bn indias gdp 2021 Digital transformation to contribute USD 154 bn to India’s GDP by 2021 Microsoft Apr 11th 2018 \nBy 2021, digital transformation will add an estimated USD 154 billion to India’s GDP, and increase the growth rate by 1.0 percent annually, according to a new business study released. The research, “Unlocking the Economic Impact of Digital Transformation in Asia Pacific”, was produced by Microsoft in partnership with IDC Asia/Pacific. \nThe s tudy predicts a dramatic acceleration in the pace of digital transformation across India and Asia Pacific’s economies. In 2017, about 4 percent of India’s GDP was derived from digital products and services created directly through the use of digital technologies, such as mobility, cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) . \n“India is clearly on the digital transformation fast track. Within the next four years, it is estimated that nearly 60 percent of India’s GDP will have a strong connection to the digital transformation trends.” said Anant Maheshwari, President, Microsoft India. “Organizations are increasingly deploying emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and that will accelerate digital transformation led growth even further.” \nThe survey conducted with 1,560 business decision makers in mid and large-sized organizations across 15 economies in the region highlights the rapid impact and widespread disruption that digital transformation is having on traditional business models. The study identified five key benefits from digital transformation. \nAccording to the research findings, organizations are seeing significant and tangible improvements from their digital transformation efforts across these benefits in the range of 11 percent to 14 percent today. Business leaders expect to see more than 40 percent improvements in those key areas by 2020, with the biggest jump expected in productivity, customer advocacy as well as profit margin. \nThe study indicates that while 90 percent of organizations in India are in the midst of their digital transformation journey, only 7 percent in the entire region can be classified as Leaders. These are organizations that have full or progressing digital transformation strategies, with at least a third of their revenue derived from digital products and services. In addition, these companies are seeing between 20 - 30 percent improvements in benefits across various business areas from their initiatives. \nThe study indicates that Leaders experience double the benefits of Followers, and these improvements will be more pronounced by 2020. Almost half of Leaders (48 percent) have a full digital transformation strategy in place. \nAdds Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,one of India’s Leaders in Digital Transformation, “Apollo Hospitals recognized the potential of technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics in providing high quality preventive healthcare services, very early on. With data being generated at an exponential proportion, technology is helping us derive insights to predict and suggest preventive steps with utmost accuracy. Our partnership with Microsoft bring us to the forefront of this remarkable metamorphosis that is allowing us to meet healthcare demand and maintain service excellence regardless of geography.” \nThe Study identified key differences between Leaders and Followers, which contribute to the improvements tracked: Leaders are more concerned about competitors and emergence of disruptive technologies: The digital economy has also given rise to new types of competitors, as well as emerging technologies such as AI that have contributed to the disruption of business models. Business agility and culture of innovation are key goals: When addressing business concerns, Leaders are focused on creating a culture of agility and innovation to counter competition. Followers, on the other hand, are more focused on improving employee productivity and profitability. Measuring digital transformation successes : Organizations across Asia Pacific are starting to adopt new key performance indicators (KPI) to better measure their digital transformation initiatives, such as effectiveness of processes, data as a capital, and customer advocacy in the form of Net Promoter Score (NPS). As organizations realize the potential of data as the new oil for the digital economy, Leaders are much more focused on leveraging data to grow revenue and productivity, and to transform business models. Leaders are more aware of challenges in their digital transformation journeys: In addition to skills and cybersecurity threats as key challenges, Leaders have also identified the need to bolster their data capabilities through the use of advanced analytics to develop actionable insights in fast-moving markets. Leaders are looking to invest in AI and Internet of Things : Emerging technologies such as AI (including cognitive services and robotics) and IoT are areas where Leaders are investing in for 2018. Besides these emerging technologies, Leaders are also more interested in investing in big data analytics to mine data for actionable insights than others. What sets Leaders apart from others are their ability to ride on the digital transformation wave from an organizational culture perspective. The study found that Leaders have these traits: \n“There is a pressing need for organizations to fully capitalize on the potential value of digital transformation in the next few years. To do so, organizations need to invest in building their ecosystem, from employees, to customers, to partners, across their value chain by gaining new insights through new data sources, and incorporating digitization in their products and services, said Anil Bhansali, Managing Director, Microsoft India (R&D) “Microsoft is uniquely positioned to help organizations in India to succeed in their digital transformation journeys today through our agile platforms and solutions that prioritize flexibility, integration and trust. We understand what organizations will need to make their journeys a successful one”, he added. \nRiding the Wave of Digital Transformation \nOrganizations in Asia Pacific need to accelerate their digital transformation journey to reap the full benefits of their initiatives, and to address the invisible revolution brought about the mass adoption of AI. More importantly, companies need to focus on capitalizing their own data in order to gain new market insights, create new digital products and services, and monetize data through data sharing securely, and in collaboration with its ecosystem. \nMicrosoft recommends organizations to adopt the following strategies to become a digital transformation Leader: Create a digital culture : An organization need to build a culture of collaboration where it is connected across business functions, and has a vibrant and mature ecosystem of customers and partners. Data can then be embraced across organization and functions, where better decisions can be made and ultimately serving the needs of customers and partners better. Build an information ecosystem : In a digital world, organizations are capture more volumes of data internally and externally. The key to becoming a Leader is for organizations to be able to convert data into capital assets, and enable data sharing and collaboration internally and externally in an open yet trusted manner. In addition, a proper data strategy will allow businesses to start their AI initiatives to identify connections, insights and trends. Embrace micro-revolutions : In most cases, digital transformation efforts do not start with widespread change, but a series of micro-revolutions. These are small, quick projects that deliver positive business outcomes and accrue to a bigger and bolder digital transformation initiatives. Develop Future Ready Skills for Individuals and Organizations: Organizations today must relook at training and reskilling its workforce so that workers are equipped with future ready skill sets such as complex problem solving, critical thinking and creativity for the digital economy. More importantly, they need to rebalance the workforce to attain and attract key digital talents, as well as be open in creating a flexible work source model where they tap into skills-based marketplace. From a digital skills perspective, LinkedIn’s latest study outlines the ABCs of digital talents required for future economies in the region – artificial intelligence, big data and cloud computing. In India, the top in-demand skills are big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. \n“The pace of digital transformation is accelerating, and IDC expects that by 2021, at least 60 percent of India’s GDP will be derived from digital products and services, with growth in every industry driven by digitally enhanced offerings, operations and relationships. The study shows Leaders seeing double the benefits of Followers, with improvements in productivity, cost reductions, and customer advocacy. To remain competitive, organizations must establish new metrics, realign organization structures, and re-architect their technology platform,\" said Daniel-Zoe Jimenez, research director Digital Transformation Practice Lead, IDC Asia/Pacific.

      "text": "Digital transformation contribute usd 154 bn indias gdp 2021 Digital transformation to contribute USD 154 bn to India’s GDP by 2021 Microsoft Apr 11th 2018 \nBy 2021, digital transformation will add an estimated USD 154 billion to India’s GDP, and increase the growth rate by 1.0 percent annually, according to a new business study released. The research, “Unlocking the Economic Impact of Digital Transformation in Asia Pacific”, was produced by Microsoft in partnership with IDC Asia/Pacific. \nThe s tudy predicts a dramatic acceleration in the pace of digital transformation across India and Asia Pacific’s economies. In 2017, about 4 percent of India’s GDP was derived from digital products and services created directly through the use of digital technologies, such as mobility, cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI) . \n“India is clearly on the digital transformation fast track. Within the next four years, it is estimated that nearly 60 percent of India’s GDP will have a strong connection to the digital transformation trends.” said Anant Maheshwari, President, Microsoft India. “Organizations are increasingly deploying emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and that will accelerate digital transformation led growth even further.” \nThe survey conducted with 1,560 business decision makers in mid and large-sized organizations across 15 economies in the region highlights the rapid impact and widespread disruption that digital transformation is having on traditional business models. The study identified five key benefits from digital transformation. \nAccording to the research findings, organizations are seeing significant and tangible improvements from their digital transformation efforts across these benefits in the range of 11 percent to 14 percent today. Business leaders expect to see more than 40 percent improvements in those key areas by 2020, with the biggest jump expected in productivity, customer advocacy as well as profit margin. \nThe study indicates that while 90 percent of organizations in India are in the midst of their digital transformation journey, only 7 percent in the entire region can be classified as Leaders. These are organizations that have full or progressing digital transformation strategies, with at least a third of their revenue derived from digital products and services. In addition, these companies are seeing between 20 - 30 percent improvements in benefits across various business areas from their initiatives. \nThe study indicates that Leaders experience double the benefits of Followers, and these improvements will be more pronounced by 2020. Almost half of Leaders (48 percent) have a full digital transformation strategy in place. \nAdds Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd.,one of India’s Leaders in Digital Transformation, “Apollo Hospitals recognized the potential of technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics in providing high quality preventive healthcare services, very early on. With data being generated at an exponential proportion, technology is helping us derive insights to predict and suggest preventive steps with utmost accuracy. Our partnership with Microsoft bring us to the forefront of this remarkable metamorphosis that is allowing us to meet healthcare demand and maintain service excellence regardless of geography.” \nThe Study identified key differences between Leaders and Followers, which contribute to the improvements tracked: Leaders are more concerned about competitors and emergence of disruptive technologies: The digital economy has also given rise to new types of competitors, as well as emerging technologies such as AI that have contributed to the disruption of business models. Business agility and culture of innovation are key goals: When addressing business concerns, Leaders are focused on creating a culture of agility and innovation to counter competition.

The multi-wall bags, from time to time with a plastic film layer dry food; are often packed, also similar bag style with film laminates are used. The Dry food will last for months. It has an extensive shelf life, due to film layer, or due to packaging. Sometimes a cat is less probable to gorge itself on the dry food, due to unpalatability and instead only eat what needs relieving hunger.

      "title": "Big Gender Pay Parity Gap at U.S. Entertainment Companies in U.K. – MovieMagic - MovieMagic",
      "text": "- Leave a Comment \nLast week, all companies in the U.K. with more than 250 employees had to report their gender pay gaps — not by choice but under a new law backed by Prime Minister Theresa May. May has called the pay gap a “burning injustice” that she is determined to eliminate within a generation. \nThe entertainment industry, long used to playing by its own rules, has not come off well. The overwhelming trend is of double-digit gaps in average pay for men over women, and vast chasms when it comes to bonuses. Ironically, big U.S. entertainment giants such as Warner Bros., Universal Music, Turner Broadcasting and Disney have had to report these sorry figures for their U.K. units but not for their operations back home, where there is no such law. Perhaps their U.S. employees will now start demanding similar information. \nMuch of the media focus has been on the size of the salary gaps. But what really tells the story about ingrained gender inequality is the disparity in bonus pay (men receive 67% more than women at Warner Bros., 88% at Live Nation, 68% at Turner Broadcasting) and the disproportion of men — usually in the region of 70% — in the upper quartile of earners. Many companies explain their “uncomfortable” figures by saying the number of men in top-earning positions skews the overall figures. But that raises the question: How did you allow this situation to persist in the 21st century and not take measures to promote women into leadership roles? \nA huge achievement of the new law is that more than 10,000 companies in the U.K. have suddenly had to take issues of gender equality seriously. There was genuine concern about reputational damage, and about having a bigger gap than a competitor. Some HR managers say the law has focused CEOs’ minds on matters such as improved parental benefits and flexible working options. \nCompanies had to file a report that not only contained pay figures but outlined policies for closing the gap. These include Columbia Pictures committing to diversity and inclusion training, Warner Bros. offering unconscious-bias awareness training to managers and Universal Music providing coaching and mentoring. But few entertainment companies committed to a specific action plan or timeline for addressing their leadership gender imbalance. One exception was news producer ITN, whose CEO vowed that no bonuses would be paid to senior managers, including himself, unless diversity targets were met. \nWhat steps must be taken to achieve equal representation of women in leadership positions? \n» Active engagement from the top leadership team. C-suite execs should lead the way, sharing the vision and actively committing their organization to a target. “He” who wields the power has the power to create change. Make line managers accountable for progressing women in the organization. \n» Flexible working options for all. Create a culture that embraces modern working practices based on output and trust. Lack of flexible working options is one of the biggest reasons why the entertainment industry is losing women at the senior level. The old-fashioned practice of five days a week in the office has stifled the progression of women. \n» Parental benefits. Increase benefits to new parents, and guarantee paid leave for new fathers. Gender inequality in the workplace won’t be solved until fathers start taking on more parenting responsibilities, and men should be applauded for doing so. Spotify has a six-month full-pay maternity and paternity leave package, while at Netflix, parents are allowed to take as much time as they want in their child’s first year on full pay. \n» Recruitment and promotion. Recruiters should be providing diverse short lists, and all managers should undergo unconscious-bias awareness training. “Interruption strategies,” such as removing names from résumés, work. \n» Career development. Coaching and mentoring for senior-level women make an enormous impact on their career advancement. Being mentored by other senior women and being coached on how to navigate an often male-dominated organization is important and effective. \nThanks to the gender pay gap legislation in Britain, issues of female equality in the workplace are finally being taken seriously. It’s provoked debate; it’s provoked action. Let’s hope the gender pay gap will soon be consigned to history. Why delay? \nClaire Singers is a gender diversity consultant and executive coach with a 30-year career in the U.K. entertainment industry. ",

      "text": "By Lalit K Jha\nWashington, Apr 11 (PTI) Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg today defended certain kind of censorship to remove terrorist propaganda after a US lawmaker expressed concern over the social media giants \"pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.\"\nTop Republican Senator Ted Cruz cited the 2016 controversy over how Facebook editors handled conservative-leaning political news in the trending topics feature.\n\"I think that you would probably agree that we should remove terrorist propaganda from the service. So that, I agree, I think it is clearly bad activity that we want to get down. And were generally proud of how well we do with that,\" Zuckerberg told the US lawmakers during a US Congressional hearing.\nZuckerberg was testifying before the US Congress amid a firestorm over the Cambridge Analytica data leak.\nIn March, it was found that British firm Cambridge Analytica tied to US President Donald Trumps 2016 campaign improperly collected profile data of up to 87 million Facebook users.\nHe said he was \"very committed\" to ensure that Facebook was a platform for all ideas.\n\"That is a very important founding principle of what we do. Were proud of the discourse and the different ideas that people can share on the service, and that is something that, as long as Im running the company, Im going to be committed to making sure is the case,\" he asserted.\n?To a great many Americans that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias. Do you agree with that assessment?? Cruz asked.\nZuckerberg said, ?I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook in the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place, and this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we do not have any bias in the work that we do, and I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about.\nFacebook, he said, do not generally ask people about their political orientation when theyre joining the company.\n\"Mr. Zuckerberg, do you feel its your responsibility to assess users, whether they are good and positive connections or ones that those 15 to 20,000 people deem unacceptable or deplorable?? Cruz asked.\n?Senator, I think that there are a number of things that we would all agree are clearly bad. Foreign interference in our elections, terrorism, self-harm,? Zuckerberg said.

GNANA DHAARA Summer Residential Training Program Rc 21 GNANA DHAARA Summer Residential Training Program Rc 21 Ref: 1. This Office Lr.R.C.No.21/B/SCERT/2018, dated: 19.03.2018 to Spl CS to Govt. SE, AP 2. Minutes of Meeting on Summer Remedial Program, dated 31.01.18, chaired by Commissioner of School Education 3. Instructions of Hon’ble Chief Minister during the Collector’s Conference, dated 19.01.18. Attention of all Regional Joint Directors, School Education (RJDSEs), District Educational Officers (DEOs), District Project Officers (POs) and Academic Monitoring Officers (AMOs) to Hon’ble Chief Minister’s vision for School Education and direction that Andhra Pradesh should be among the top three performers in the country in National Assessments of Student Learning Outcomes by 2022. In order to achieve this vision, the Education system needs to equip its students not only with literacy and numeracy, but with knowledge and skills relevant for the 21st Century. Recently conducted National Achievement Survey [NAS 2017] and Annual Status of Education Report [ASER 2017] surveys mirror the results from the recent Summative Assessment [SA-1] conducted in objective mode for Classes 8th and 9th. While NAS showed a declining trend in performance of AP students moving towards Upper Primary and Secondary Education, ASER revealed that barely 59% of the youth in Srikakulam district could do basic division. Further, analysis of the results of Class 9 students of SA1 revealed that 51%, 47% and 25% of the students secured D1 and D2 grades, in Maths, Science and English subjects respectively. In view of all these findings, and in line with the directions of Hon’ble Chief Minister in ref. 3 cited, the School Education Department is developing a clear action plan to address gaps identified in NAS, ASER and other assessment reports. As discussed with MHRD and Sp. Chief Secretary, School Education during review meetings, there is a need to put in place a sustainable model of remedial teaching with the objective of bringing low performing students to grade level. Further, recent data on drop - outs shows that nearly 22,000 students dropped out in transition from Class 9 to Class 10 in AY 2016-17. Students who are entering Class 6 are also transitioning from Primary Schools to High Schools without appropriate grade level competencies thus impeding their ability to cope up with the syllabus at High School. The resultant plan of action for long-term remediation for low performing students in all grades, called Gnana Dhaara is designed. A comprehensive Remedial programme is proposed to be conducted to the identified low performing students in all grades under different managements. The remediation program called Gnana Dhaara will be conducted in 2 phases- i) Summer Residential Program and ii) Year long Learning Enhancement Program. Core aspects of GnanaDhaara, yearlong continuous remedial program This program will focus on improving learning levels of students of all Govt. and government aided private schools. Support will be provided by way of workbooks, teaching guidelines to Private school managements too. Subjects to be covered: English, Telugu, Mathematics and Science Students from all classes [1-10] to be covered Teaching Learning material and Student-friendly workbooks will be designed and provided by School Education Department. Respective managements to use them for remedial coaching program. Subject teachers in schools will deliver remediation- training to all teachers through e-platforms to improve the delivery of remedial pedagogy As a precursor to the Year-long remediation, Summer Residential Remedial (SRP) program will be implemented in the following manner: For whom : Students entering classes 6 and 10 in AY 2018-19 will be considered, to help them bridge the transition from primary school to high school, and to give the Class 9 students confidence while going into Class 10 [SSC Board]. Subjects : Maths, Language and Science will be the focus subjects for Class 10, while Telugu, English, Science and Maths will be the focus for Class 6. How : Content will seek to impart foundational knowledge in all subjects so that the student is ready to absorb the lessons with full comprehension once school session starts. Activity based pedagogy will be employed by the teachers to better explain concepts to the students. Resources: Volunteer teachers from School Education, Municipal, Social Welfare, Tribal Welfare and Model schools will be leveraged @ TPR of 1:40. B.Ed. and DIET Teacher students will be leveraged to be in-house teachers Pedagogy: Student friendly workbooks will be designed for students to practice at home with interest and to improve their skills. Where : Residential program involving Residential hostels of Social Welfare, Tribal Welfare, Minority Welfare, BC Welfare, APREIS, AP Model Schools, KGBVs and Girls Hostels will be utilized.

      "text": "New Delhi: Premium British lifestyle brand Carlton London partnered with Ace Turtle , an omnichannel platform company to ramp up its e-commerce business in India.\nAce Turtle's proprietary omnichannel platform, Rubicon, will power Carlton London's e-commerce business through seamless inventory and catalogue management across existing and new demand generation channels.\nHaving a meaningful presence across multiple retail channels has become one of the top priorities of any large brand. However, control over the presence of inventory across multiple retail channels has always been a challenge that retailers are grappling with. Ace Turtle's Rubicon platform through its tech capabilities aligns inventory view and allocation of stock towards the channel that performs the best.\n\"India's retail consumerism is going through a paradigm shift with customers interacting with brands through various channels. The rise of e-commerce has ensured growing dominance of online channels, as one of the most preferred platforms to optimise sales. However, adoption of technology becomes critical in ensuring optimisation of fulfilment using data. We are confident that Ace Turtle's platform will add significant value in scaling up our omnichannel business in India,\" said Business Head of Carlton London, Kim Virk .\nRubicon will provide real-time information about the availability of inventory across the brand, regardless of which channel is accessed. Moreover, a single feed of catalogue, pricing, and inventory shared with all multiple retail channels will ensure consistent brand representation, feature rich descriptions and real-time inventory for better control in the multiple retail channels.\nThe growing awareness of global fashion trends in India has been fueled by the increasing internet consumption. As a result, consumers are conscious not only of the international styles but also about the lifestyle attributes connected to the brand, leading to increasing penetration of premium international brand.\nIn this regard, Carlton London, by venturing into multiple retail channels operation, aims to reach out to a wider audience across geographies.",

      "text": "Home / World / Facebook Data Breach: Mark Zuckerberg defends certain type of censorship to remove terrorist propaganda Facebook Data Breach: Mark Zuckerberg defends certain type of censorship to remove terrorist propaganda — By Lalit K Jha/PTI | Apr 11, 2018 02:10 pm FOLLOW US: Facebook co-founder, Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before a combined Senate Judiciary and Commerce committee. Photo by Zach Gibson/Getty Images) Washington: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg today defended certain kind of censorship to remove terrorist propaganda after a US lawmaker expressed concern over the social media giant’s “pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.” Top Republican Senator Ted Cruz cited the 2016 controversy over how Facebook editors handled conservative-leaning political news in the trending topics feature. “I think that you would probably agree that we should remove terrorist propaganda from the service. So that, I agree, I think it is a clearly bad activity that we want to get down. And we’re generally proud of how well we do with that,” Zuckerberg told the US lawmakers during a US Congressional hearing. Zuckerberg was testifying before the US Congress amid a firestorm over the Cambridge Analytica data leak. In March, it was found that British firm Cambridge Analytica tied to US President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign improperly collected profile data of up to 87 million Facebook users. He said he was “very committed” to ensure that Facebook was a platform for all ideas. “That is a very important founding principle of what we do. We’re proud of the discourse and the different ideas that people can share on the service, and that is something that, as long as I’m running the company, I’m going to be committed to making sure is the case,” he asserted. “To a great many Americans that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias. Do you agree with that assessment?” Cruz asked. Zuckerberg said, “I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook in the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place, and this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we do not have any bias in the work that we do, and I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about. Facebook, he said, do not generally ask people about their political orientation when they’re joining the company. “Mr. Zuckerberg, do you feel its your responsibility to assess users, whether they are good and positive connections or ones that those 15 to 20,000 people deem unacceptable or deplorable?” Cruz asked. “Senator, I think that there are a number of things that we would all agree are clearly bad. Foreign interference in our elections, terrorism, self-harm,” Zuckerberg said. Share this Post:",

      "text": "Korean ‘King of Pop’ lives on after half a century Australian 8 hours ago 0 0 2 minutes read Share Google+ VKontakte Telegram Viber Cho Yong-pil is widely referred in Korea as “Gawang” — the king of singing or pop music. The nickname is hardly an exaggeration, as the famed singer has performed everything from pop, rock, trot and folk to even songs comparable to contemporary K-pop, in an unparalleled music career.\n“I found such a nickname actually burdensome. That was never my goal when I sang, I don’t know about being the top, or setting records. I just did it because I love music,” he said at a press conference Wednesday in Seoul to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his debut. \nCho Yong-pil poses at a press conference Wednesday in Seoul to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his debut. (Yonhap) \nConsidered one of the greatest and most influential pop artists in Korea, Cho has released 19 studio albums since his single “Come Back to Busan Port” in 1976. He holds an array of records, becoming the first Korean pop singer to perform at the Carnegie Hall and the first to hit platinum in 1980. \nOne of the most notable aspects of the seasoned singer is that he is never complacent about his achievements. \nIn 2013, he shocked virtually everyone in the Korean music scene with his new 19th album “Hello” and lead single “Bounce.” The album adopted an upbeat, bouncy tune marking a stark contrast to previous songs, a change not expected by anyone. \nCho said the key to staying relevant is studying the latest trends in music. \n“I always talk about how I can continue my musical career. I keep on getting older, and there is no other choice,” he said. \nDespite being one of the most revered figures in Korean music, he still seeks input from much younger colleagues in the K-pop scene. \n“I listen to new songs every day, through YouTube and TV shows. I of course listen to songs by BTS and EXO. When you see the stars of today, there is a clear reason why people cheer about it,” Cho said. \nHe jokingly added that it is a good thing he is not competing against today’s K-pop stars. “If I came out today, I never would’ve made it. In terms of the looks — they are just too good looking,” he said. Cho speaks at a press conference held Wednesday in Seoul to commemorate his 50-year career. (Yonhap) \nTo mark 50 years of his career, Cho will hold a tour across Korea in May and June. It will kick off with a Seoul concert at Jamsil Sports Complex on May 12, moving to Daegu Stadium on May 19 and Gwangju World Cup Stadium on June 6. It will wrap up with concert at Uijeongbu Stadium in Gyeonggi Province on June 9. \nThe concert will be themed on thanking fans and sharing past memories, which Cho said would make for longer concerts. \nCho has been working on his latest studio album since last year, which will be his 20th full-length album. \n“Some people say, ‘Don’t you have to release a song about life at your age?’ I scoff at such thinking,” he said. “ Music is music, and it will be remembered in history as such. Let poets discuss life but a song is just a song.” \nHis unwavering love for music and his relentless will never to be complacent is what his contemporaries say is one of his biggest strengths. \nBae cheol-soo, a former singer and radio show host, described Cho as a “natural born singer” never afraid to try a new genre. This, according to Cho, was why he started music in the first place. \n“No matter how long my career has been, I have to keep studying music and I keep finding new things. They shock me all the time. I’m still learning, and I believe I would have to learn until the day I die,” he said, a testament to the “natural-born singer” he is. \nBy Yoon Min-sik( ) ",

      "text": "you are here: Home News Business Apr 11, 2018 02:22 PM IST | Source: PTI Zuckerberg defends certain type of censorship on Facebook Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg today defended certain kind of censorship to remove terrorist propaganda after a US lawmaker expressed concern over the social media giant's \"pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.\" PTI @moneycontrolcom \nFacebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg today defended certain kind of censorship to remove terrorist propaganda after a US lawmaker expressed concern over the social media giant's \"pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship.\" \nTop Republican Senator Ted Cruz cited the 2016 controversy over how Facebook editors handled conservative-leaning political news in the trending topics feature. \n\"I think that you would probably agree that we should remove terrorist propaganda from the service. So that, I agree, I think it is clearly bad activity that we want to get down. And were generally proud of how well we do with that,\" Zuckerberg told the US lawmakers during a US Congressional hearing. \nZuckerberg was testifying before the US Congress amid a firestorm over the Cambridge Analytica data leak. related news \nIn March, it was found that British firm Cambridge Analytica tied to US President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign improperly collected profile data of up to 87 million Facebook users. \nHe said he was \"very committed\" to ensure that Facebook was a platform for all ideas. \n\"That is a very important founding principle of what we do. We're proud of the discourse and the different ideas that people can share on the service, and that is something that, as long as I'm running the company, I'm going to be committed to making sure is the case,\" he asserted. \n“To a great many Americans that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias. Do you agree with that assessment?” Cruz asked. \nZuckerberg said, “I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook in the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place, and this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we do not have any bias in the work that we do, and I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about. \nFacebook, he said, do not generally ask people about their political orientation when they're joining the company. \n\"Mr. Zuckerberg, do you feel its your responsibility to assess users, whether they are good and positive connections or ones that those 15 to 20,000 people deem unacceptable or deplorable?” Cruz asked. “Senator, I think that there are a number of things that we would all agree are clearly bad. Foreign interference in our elections, terrorism, self-harm,” Zuckerberg said.",

      "text": "Email Print B Swaminathan Indore based Vasundhra Infocomm is one of the leading dealers in and around the Indore region. With six outlets within the city and three in the neighboring regions. The retailer has both single brand and multi-brand outlets across Indore and neighboring regions. In a chat for Cell IT, Nutan Jakhetiya, speaks on the expansion plans. Edited excerpts. What are the key trends you notice in the customer sale point ? The current trend here is towards the price range 20 thousand models. Some of the key trends I see here are the customers attraction towards camera, selfie and dual selfie feature. Also another trend I notice is the increase in the sale through the EMI options. Earlier people were not having any issues with buying through cash. However, now more sale is happening through financing model. Even the financing companies are coming up with attractive offers. Don’t you think the expectations towards battery is changing? Yes. However, customers are now aware of the shift. We faced such complaints from the customers on the issues related to battery during the shift from normal mobiles to android mobiles. Where customers were used to charge their phones once in three days were forced to charge it regularly. Initially customers tried changing the brands. However, ended up coming to a conclusion that most of the mobile brands are the same. How is the market in the neighboring regions of Indore? If you ask me, the rents and cost of the resources are going high but the margins are also turning thin. Also, the competition is becoming tougher day to day. However, to a surprise, the market in the tier-2 cities are welcoming. I run three stores outside Indore and six within the city. Even though the turn-over might be less, the margins are supportive compared to Indore. Are you aiming for expansion? I do not intend to expand physically. But, I look at expanding vertical-wise. We are looking for some brands to tie-up which will bring us valuable customers. There were threat from online players earlier. However, for the past few days, there is no such threats and the rates are common across. What are your top 3 priorities for this financial year? The top three priorities include bringing back some of the old customers whom we might have lost in the last 12 years, increasing the margins and profits across all business divisions.",

      "text": "A biosphere reserve in danger THE location of the Sterlite plant, in Thoothukudi, is a sore point with environmentalists. They blame the Tamil Nadu government for all... » In Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi district, protests against Sterlite’s copper smelter plant get a second wind as local residents’ health and environmental concerns over the company’s expansion plan lead to the revival of a long-forgotten people’s movement. By ILANGOVAN RAJASEKARAN \nPEOPLE of the port town of Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) in Tamil Nadu had never before poured out onto the streets in such large numbers as they did on March 24 in solidarity with the 100-odd residents of Kumareddiapuram who are waging a battle against the proposed Rs.3,500-crore expansion plan of Sterlite Industries (India) Limited’s giant copper smelter plant situated in the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu Limited (SIPCOT) complex that adjoins Kumareddiapuram and a few other villages. \nThe residents fear that the Sterlite Copper plant will rob them of their livelihoods and, perhaps more importantly, “cripple future generations”. The spontaneous mass turnout, which was likened to the “Marina struggle” of 2016 in Chennai, and the shutdown of business establishments and shops in protest against what they called “the most hazardously polluting agent” paralysed the town for eight hours and also revived the spirit of the mass agitation of a decade or so ago against the smelter plant. \nNeither the residents of the villages nor those who had been fighting against the plant for close to two decades anticipated such an overwhelming response cutting across all sections of society. The protesting residents of Kumareddiapuram had been on a sit-in strike for more than 60 days before the March 24 show of solidarity. On that day the people staged a day-long agitation in Thoothukudi town demanding that the State government close down the plant, since “it has scant respect for people’s livelihoods and the environment”. Predictably, the environmental concerns have put the industry’s expansion plans in jeopardy. \n“With no clean air to breathe and no potable water to drink, we are trapped in this village,” said Madathi, 70, of Kumareddiapuram. “The land has remained fallow and barren. Though it is rain-fed dry land, we used to cultivate pulses, maize, and so on. But farming is no longer feasible. The groundwater has been totally contaminated. We also suffer from chronic lung and skin infections. A sharp increase in cancer patients among us is also noticeable,” she added. \nSterlite Industries, a subsidiary of the London-listed conglomerate Vedanta Resources, has been synonymous with controversy since the day the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa laid the foundation stone for the Rs.1,300-crore smelter project on October 31, 1994, despite stiff opposition from residents. “Sterlite is one of the dream projects in the process of industrialising the State,” she had declared at the function. The industry was given top priority with fast-track clearances from multiple departments of both State and Central governments. “Even the Environment Impact Assessment report was not ready then,” said activists. \nThe people of Thoothukudi realised that Sterlite had been on the run from Goa to Gujarat to Maharashtra following people’s agitations against it before it pitched its tent in Tamil Nadu. In Ratnagiri in Maharashtra, Sterlite had spent nearly Rs.300 crore on construction in a year when local residents and farmers, led by activists such as the environmentalist Rashmi Mayur, opposed the project. The Sharad Pawar-headed Maharashtra government in the 1990s asked the company to fold up and leave. \nHowever, Tamil Nadu was more than accommodative. “People are wondering why an industry with such a reputation had ever been allowed,” said Tamilmandan, a fisherman and an active member of the Anti-Sterlite Movement (ASM), one of the first forums in Tamil Nadu that opposed the plant from the time its construction began. \nThe plant in Thoothukudi uses the Isa smelt process and holds a 36 per cent market share in the country’s copper industry. It has a custom smelter, a refinery, a phosphoric acid plant, a sulphuric acid plant and a copper rod plant, besides three captive power plants. In financial year 2017, the smelter registered a record production of 402,000 tonnes of copper cathodes. Its operations, said M. Esakkiappan, head (PR Department), Sterlite Copper, began in January 1997 with the setting up of the 391 tonnes per day smelter and phosphoric acid plant. Subsequently, he said, “production was enhanced to 1,200 tpd, which is the current production capacity”. He added: “The plant is currently India’s largest and the world’s seventh largest copper producer. It is also the fifth largest company in Tamil Nadu. We contribute 3.3 per cent of Tamil Nadu’s GSDP [gross State domestic product] and our contribution to the State exchequer in FY 2017 was about Rs.1,900 crore. We have invested $80 million in multiple environmental measures.” \nBut it was another record of the plant that was worrisome, said activists. In the last nearly 24 years of its existence, it has had to close down several times on the orders of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and the courts. The plant has faced investigations following accidents, some of them serious, and has been the subject of several studies by environmental and other agencies. It is still fighting many of these cases before various judicial forums. It was even fined Rs.100 crore by the Supreme Court, which ordered the amount to be deposited to “compensate its victims, if there are any, and to carry out ecological restoration work”. ‘Pollution capital’ \nThoothukudi has, the town’s residents say, emerged as the State’s “pollution capital”, what with many chemical industries in the area spewing out noxious fumes. Instead of addressing satisfactorily the issues that people raise, Sterlite, it is alleged, resorted to knee-jerk responses and indulged in what the protesters called “unethical practices” to break their protest. \nThe anti-Sterlite agitation has to be studied in two phases—from 1994 to 1999 and from March 23, 2013, when a gas leak hit the town, to the present people’s movement. Fearing that it would pollute the environment heavily, a team of environmentalists, academics, traders, fishermen, political leaders and non-profit organisations came together under the ASM in 1994. \nIts agitations were coordinated by a team of local people, including M. Appadurai, district secretary of the Communist Party of India, Tamilmandan, and later Anton Gomez of Punnakayal fishing village, who was also State convener of the National Forum for Environmental Protection. Representatives from all sections of society were included on the committee. \nThe protests did not deter Sterlite from commissioning its facility in January 1997, but in a hush-hush manner. In fact, even the town and its people were not aware of the plant going on stream. By then the State, too, had seen a change in the government with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) winning the 1996 Assembly elections. “Since then, it has been a long and arduous struggle against an industrial giant that flaunts all resources at its disposal. It has been a tough time. Now we have reached a stage where public opinion against it is getting consolidated. We focus on our objective—the permanent closure of the plant,” said Fatima Babu, a former college professor and one of the leading protesters since 1994. Sustained campaign \nPeople in Thoothukudi recall how they, with support from all sections of society, had launched a coordinated campaign, which sadly petered out mainly owing to differences of opinion among the movement’s members. Initially, the church took the initiative in organising protests involving a large number of fishermen. “It was natural that fishermen were apprehensive. Discharge of effluents into the ecologically fragile Gulf of Mannar, they feared, would destroy fish breeding spots and jeopardise their livelihood,” Tamilmandan said. \nIn fact, a sustained campaign by leaders such as George Fernandes, Medha Patkar, Rashmi Mayur and fishermen’s leader Thomas Kocherry bolstered the people’s movement against the company and the pollution it was allegedly causing. Political leaders like Vaiko, Dr K. Krishnaswamy and others, too, lent their support initially, as did non-profitable organisations such as Poovulagin Nanbargal, People’s Watch and the Tamil Nadu Environmental Association. \n“When the protests grew, Sterlite resorted to all sorts of unfair activities. We could see the leaders and active members slowly withdrawing from us,” claimed Tamilmandan. Sterlite, according to those who were active in the agitation in the 1990s, resorted to dubious manoeuvres to break the movement. One of its ploys was to sow the seeds of suspicion among members. “In fact, we should concede that they succeeded in their attempts. The movement’s core team disintegrated. Citing no reasons, many walked out,” he told Frontline . \nThe people’s movement could not carry the agitation forward. Besides, Sterlite also simultaneously carried out social welfare initiatives in and around Thoothukudi in order to counter the resistance and isolate the protesters. Despite all this, hardly a day passed without a strike, protest, lockout or blockade in the town. The efforts paid off at times. \nThe protesters, mainly fishermen, prevented Sterlite from laying an eight-kilometre-long pipeline cutting through the town to discharge effluents into the sea. Farmers in rural areas, too, staged agitations when the State government, in its order of February 28, 1995, allocated water to Sterlite Industries (2.50 million gallons a day) from its 20 mgd water supply scheme from the Tamiraparani river. The ayacutdars and other stakeholders were annoyed over the supply of water to industries in the SIPCOT complex at the cost of agriculture and drinking water needs. \nSterlite moved cautiously to prevent the regrouping and reconsolidation of the ASM. Traders and business establishments, who initially extended support to the movement, were its first target; they were reportedly bullied and intimidated into retreating, allegedly with the connivance of the State government. “A trade body that raised objections initially, issued a press release later welcoming the project. Thus the trading community was forced to withdraw from the movement. The next target was the residents of the villages around the plant. Promises were made, jobs were offered and the vital needs of villages were met. Till today, Sterlite is paying the annual water charges of a major village, running into several lakhs of rupees. Contract works were given to local panchayat leaders,” said an activist. Violent turn \nAll the while the struggle had remained peaceful. That situation changed on January 26, 1997, when country bombs were thrown at the house of the then senior vice president of the plant. No one was injured in the explosions, nor was any property damaged. Then, in April 1998 a blast damaged high tension power lines that supply electricity to the plant. Two unknown outfits, the Tamil Nadu Communist Party and the Tamil Nadu Liberation Army, claimed responsibility and handbills seized from the site claimed that it was a protest against Sterlite. \nTamilmandan, one of the coordinators of the movement, was arrested. He denied any involvement in the blast. “I was harassed and tortured. Many other members were threatened. When it was over, the people’s movement got diluted with none to coordinate its activities. Those who were with me had also left. I had to fight all alone to get myself exonerated of all the charges. When I was actively involved in the movement, I was just 30. I could marry only at the age of 41. Only fishermen and a few of my friends stood by me at that time of crisis,” he said. \nSince then the fight against Sterlite has been confined mostly to the courts. Anton Gomez, a veteran environmental activist, did not hesitate to endorse Tamilmandan’s claims. “Many political leaders who promised to stand by us deserted us. Many of us lost our livelihoods and suffered mentally and physically while fighting against a powerful industrial conglomerate,” he said. Fishermen persevere \nFishermen, however, remained strong at the centre of the struggle and adopted novel methods of protest. In March 1996, they staged a sea blockade to stop a ship that had a consignment of copper ore meant for the Sterlite plant. “The ship was forced to return from Tuticorin port. Later, the raw materials were transported by road from Kochi port,” Anton Gomez said. In October 1996, on the request of the protesters, port workers, led by their leader and the slain Dalit leader C. Pasupathipandian, refused to handle the cargo on a ship, forcing the ship to return to the sea, he added. \nAt the same time, Thoothukudi district (then Chidambaranar district) and Thoothukudi town were caught in the vortex of caste and communal clashes, leading to simmering unrest. A major riot broke out between two major communities, Nadars and fishermen (Bharathavars), in 1996, which raged for three days, from May 9 to 11. A young fisherman was killed in police firing and five persons sustained serious injuries in bomb attacks during the riots and a lot of property was damaged. \nThe State government instituted a commission of inquiry under a district judge, V.K. Thirunavukkarasu. As many as 407 affidavits and 1,055 documents were filed before the commission. In all, 281 witnesses deposed. The police registered 227 first information reports and the property loss in the arson was estimated at Rs.10.32 crore. A total of 220 persons were affected in the riot. In its report submitted to the government on October 3, 1997, the commission suggested measures to restore peace and confidence in society. \nAway from the urban limits of Thoothukudi, violence erupted in rural pockets, too, following caste clashes between Dalits and Maravas. Police high-handedness in the Dalit village of Kodiyankulam in 1996 led to the caste clashes spreading quickly to neighbouring districts. This situation persisted for seven years and took the vigour off the people’s movement against Sterlite. “These extraneous reasons and the infiltration of alien forces and their organisations weakened our struggle. We hope the revival of the agitation includes all sections of people to make it a success,” said Anton Gomez. Old-timers said they were ready to join the present team. Health hazards \nOne of the important issues that revived the agitation is people’s concerns over the health hazards posed by environmental pollution. These included breathlessness and other respiratory problems, burning sensation in the eyes and nose, and an increase in the number of cancer cases, all this especially among those living in the vicinity of the plant. \nThere have been many casualties among workers in the plant. The first major mishap within the plant was reported on May 3, 1997, when a labourer was charred to death as a pipeline carrying sulphuric acid broke and the acid spilled over him. In April 1998, six workers were burnt to death on the plant’s premises. “Fatal and serious accidents have become a routine affair though the management has either maintained a stoic silence or distanced itself from them,” said M. Krishnamurthi, who has been active in the anti-Sterlite struggle since the late 1990s. \nTwo major incidents relating to environmental pollution took place in 1997. On July 5 that year, about 160 women workers of a dry flower export unit located adjacent to the smelter plant swooned because, as it was later found, of a high concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the air. About 45 of them were rushed to hospital and discharged after five days. On August 20, workers of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board’s substation near the plant complained of nausea and vomiting. “These incidents created panic among the people in Thoothukudi. George Fernandes came to the town and led a protest against the plant,” said Krishnamurthi. \nSterlite denied all the charges of pollution. The Thoothukudi district administration, fearing reprisal from the public, ordered the plant’s closure after the gas leak. Two expert panels were formed to assess the situation and submit reports to the government. The reports claimed that the source of the toxic emissions could not be traced to Sterlite since other industries that handled SO2 were also functioning in the neighbourhood. “Accepting the finding, the then DMK government led by M. Karunanidhi allowed the plant to reopen,” pointed out Kappikulam J. Prabhakar, who has been following the stir against Sterlite closely since 2000. Incidents of gas leak continued to occur. On March 2, 1999, it was reported, a few workers in the relay station of All India Radio situated near the plant complained of breathlessness and nausea. A major leak that put the industry in a spot took place in the early hours of March 23, 2013. On that day, citizens of Thoothukudi woke up with burning eyes, breathing difficulties and soreness in the throat. Panic gripped the town and the district administration quickly formed squads to identify the source of the leak. Later, after obtaining a report from the TNPCB, it ordered the plant’s closure on March 29. The administration also served notice on Sterlite saying that the company had contravened the provisions of Section 21 of the Air Act, 1981, as amended in 1987. \nThough government records on the gas leak are not available, which led to many conflicting claims, some environmentalists, quoting independent studies, said the SO2 trend graph of ambient air quality in the plant indicated that the emission value had shot up suddenly from 20 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) to 62 µg/m3. Another study claimed that the air over Thoothukudi town in the wee hours of March 23 carried a load of SO2 ranging between 803.5 parts per million (ppm) and 1,023.6 ppm while the prescribed standard is said to be 477.53 ppm at the tip of the industry’s stack. Sterlite’s denial \nSterlite denied all accusations. It claimed that the factory was closed for maintenance on March 21 and 22. A preliminary report from the TNPCB said that the air at that time was found to have contained 2,941.12 µg/m3 of SO2 against the permissible level of 1,250 µg/m3. Sterlite maintained that the leak could have been possible from other chemical industries. However, the direction of the wind from the company’s location towards the town at that time of the leak pointed to the strong possibility that the source of the leak could be Sterlite. \n“This incident sowed the seeds of fear and anger in the minds of residents. After the leak, the movement has started building up again in the town. The people’s continuous stir has provided the traction today. That was why on March 24 this year, nearly two lakh people turned out in support of the anti-Sterlite agitation,” said Krishnamurti. Court cases \nSterlite has been facing a number of cases in various courts and also in the National Green Tribunal (NGT). The Madras High Court ordered the plant’s closure on November 23, 1998, on the basis of a petition filed by the non-governmental organisation National Trust for Clean Environment, which stated that the environmental clearance granted by the State government to the plant was in violation of the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, and other notifications issued thereafter. Vaiko, and K. Kanagaraj and Appadurai of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) impleaded themselves in the case. \nSterlite filed a petition, on the basis of which the Madras High Court modified its order on December 1, 1998, and allowed the industry to resume its operations, pending the results of a study that it asked the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to carry out. On the basis of the NEERI report, the court ordered the closure of the plant on September 28, 2010. Justice Elipe Dharmarao, who wrote the judgment for the two-member bench including Justice N. Paul Vasanthakumar, observed: “The materials on record show that the continuing air pollution being caused by the noxious effluents discharged into the air by the respondent company is having a more devastating effect on the people living in the surroundings.” \nThe company went in appeal to the Supreme Court. The two-member Supreme Court bench of Justices A.K. Patnaik and H.L. Gokhale, in its final order on April 2, 2013, asked the industry to pay a penalty of Rs.100 crore, and allowed it to continue operations. The Supreme Court justified the penalty and said the amount would be deposited in a nationalised bank in a fixed deposit for a period of five years. The interest that accrued from it would be spent on improving the environment, water and soil in the area. \nWriting the judgment, Justice Patnaik said the court was of the view that the industry should be held liable to pay compensation for having polluted the environment and for having operated the plant without getting renewals from the appropriate authorities such as the TNPCB for long periods. The judgment observed: \n“Any less amount would not have the desired deterrent effect on the appellant company.” While accepting that the company “no doubt” had “misrepresented and suppressed material facts”, the court pointed out that “the plant of appellants contributes substantially to the copper production in India, and copper is used in defence, electricity, automobile, construction and infrastructure, etc. \n“For this consideration of public interest, we do not think it will be a proper exercise of our discretion under Article 136 of the Constitution to refuse relief on the grounds of misrepresentation and suppression of facts.” \nThe bench, in a significant observation, made it clear that “this judgment will not stand in the way of TNPCB issuing directions to the appellant company, including direction for closure of the plant for the protection of environment in accordance with law”. \nAlthough the Rs.100-crore fine, as part of the “polluter pays” principle, makes the company a liable party for compensation, environmentalists claim that it in a way helps the industry to whitewash its on-the-other-side-of-law activities. \nIn the meantime, the Thoothukudi district administration had ordered the closure of the plant following the March 2013 gas leak. Unfortunately, the State government had failed to establish the source of the gas leak as Sterlite. The matter came up before the southern zone of the NGT, which transferred it to the NGT Principal Bench in New Delhi. The NGT Principal Bench, on May 31, 2013, constituted a five-member expert committee to study and submit a comprehensive report. \nSterlite’s Esakkiappan said that thereafter, the NGT observed in its interim order dated July 15, 2013: “Let the appellant industry proceed to comply with recommendations/suggestions made by special expert committee within a time bound schedule. Since the appellant company is neither an existing pollutant nor is a threat of future pollution (not violating prescribed standards) resulting in health hazards, we see no reason to vary our interim order dated 31st May, 2013.” \nIn January 2010, on a petition filed by S. Pushparayan, a member of the non-profit organisation East Coast Research and Development, the Madras High Court stayed the proposed expansion of the plant since it did not hold public hearings mandated for such projects under the country’s environmental protection rules. The stay was vacated later. Expansion plans \nSterlite’s estimated Rs.3,500-crore expansion plan on a 400-acre (160-hectare) facility scheduled to be completed in the next two years now hinges on clearances from the NGT, the courts and the State government. The expansion includes a smelter, a power plant and a desalination plant. It would double its capacity to produce 8,00,000 tonnes per annum. Said Esakkiappan: “Our smelter at Tuticorin has already received all the regulatory clearances for the expansion.” The main plant, however, will have to wait for the State government to renew its recently expired licence (renewal consent). \nThe renewed anti-Sterlite struggle underscores the fact that a long-drawn-out battle is on the cards. \nAnd the cries of the people of Thoothukudi, “Copper for Sterlite and Cancer for People”, seem to be reaching a crescendo.",

      "text": "Fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies are expected to report an improving trend of volume growth, in addition to GST-led savings and recovery in functioning of trade channels to pre-GST levels.\nWhile brokerage houses differ when it comes to estimating top line growth of these companies, a key aspect market would be volume growth in rural counters picking up to levels similar to those of urban areas.\nAccording to Kotak Institutional Equities, the performance of these companies in the March quarter is not strictly comparable with the same quarter last year due to GST-led reporting changes and the impact of demonetisation in the base quarter.\nHowever, FMCG firms are expected to post a net revenue growth of 11.8 percent in the March quarter, which would be the highest in the last 18 quarters.\nHimadri Buch Assistant Editor|Moneycontrol.com IDFC Mutual Fund to rename, revise features of 2 open-ended equity schemes Domestic mutual funds cautious on ICICI Bank, Axis Bank over leadership uncertainty Indiabulls MF’s equity head Sumit Bhatnagar expects FY19 to be volatile The good news is that most companies have settled down in the new GST regime, although exporters remain troubled by delays in refunds. FMCG companies, in particular, should do well, now that supply chains are running smoothly; they would benefit from GST credit.\n\"At an aggregate level, we expect net revenue growth of 11.8 per cent, highest in the past 18 quarters. We expect 9.9 per cent growth for the staples pack, slightly lower than third quarter FY18's 11.2 percent on a reported basis but higher on a base-adjusted basis,\" Kotak Institutional Equities stated in its preview report.\nThe report estimated aggregate revenue growth for the discretionary pack at 13.5 percent, while aggregate volume growth was pegged at 8 percent.\nThe brokerage noted that companies have started increasing prices selectively to pass on raw material inflation, after being cautious for the first few months after GST was first implemented.\nKotak Institutional Equities expects a 22 percent growth over the previous fiscal year for adjusted profit after tax, the highest since the first quarter of FY13. It expects the long-anticipated volume growth uptick to show up, while margins, aided partly by GST, are likely to expand further for most companies.\nAccording to Motilal Oswal Research, Britannia Industries, Page Industries, Nestle India, Pidilite Industries, Colgate Palmolive India, and United Breweries are expected to post a strong set of numbers, with PAT growth in excess of 17 percent, whereas Emami and Jyothy Labs will report a de-growth in net profit.\nAccording to a report from Edelweiss, the consumer goods pack's revenue, EBITDA and PAT growth is likely to be 6.9 percent, 13 percent and 12.1 percent, respectively, on a softer base.\nThe third quarter of FY18 saw the revenue, EBITDA and net profit of the companies grow at 8.6 percent, 16 percent and 18.2 percent year-on-year, respectively.\nVolume growth this quarter is largely similar for rural and urban clusters. The CSD channel is recovering, but it will take few quarters before it can recover completely.\nGST rate cuts announced in November 2017 had led to price cuts on wide spectrum of consumer goods products, which are also aiding improved offtake.\nOn the international front, the currency devaluation issue of MENA (Middle East and North Africa) is now in the base and hence, growth rate should look optically better.\nGross margin expansion will be limited, since companies have not hiked prices materially. EBITDA margin expansion will, however, be seen on the back of calibrated ad spends as well as cost rationalisation measures.\nEdelweiss expects HUL, Dabur, Emami, Bajaj Corp, Britannia, Nestle and Colgate to report volume growth in the range 4-8 percent YoY (except Britannia whose volume growth is likely to be 10-11 percent YoY).\nGCPL is likely to see a growth of 4-5 percent in domestic revenue, whereas Marico is likely to see flattish-to-negative volume growth in Parachute and Saffola.\nThe brokerage firm expects ITC to post a decline of around 1 percent YoY and a decline in its cigarette business on a flat base.",

      "text": "Weight Loss May Help You Sleep Better: 5 Foods That May Help Burn Fat April 11, 2018 3 \nLosing those few inches round your belly, may help you have a good night sleep, says an Australian based study. According to a research by the Flinders University Adelaide's Institute for Sleep Health, few dietary tweaks and alterations may not just help you achieve your weight loss goals, but also reduce the worst effects of Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA). Obstructive Sleep Apnoea is a sleep disorder in which a person experiences pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep. This prevents air from entering the lungs, causing disturbance in sleep. It has been a well-established fact that inadequate sleep may be closely linked to weight gain. The latest study claims there may be a reverse connect too.In the course of the study that ran for six months, participants who opted for a balanced meal replacement, did not just witness effective weight loss but an improved sleep pattern too. Participants also saw a positive reduction in their cholesterol, blood pressure and blood glucose quite early in the program.Sleep and weight loss are quite closely interlinked. It is very essential to have a sound sleep for healthy weight loss. Not enough sleep is most likely to result in high level of your cortisol levels, which leads to fat gain. 5 foods that may help burn fat faster \n1. Green tea Green tea is a natural antioxidant; it contains seven percent of the active molecule EGCG. Its polyphenols help to speed the metabolism and boost fat-burning during exercising. 2. Turmeric Turmeric is known to be an anti-inflammatory and it has been bagged as one of the top health trends of the year 2017. This spice contains curcumin, a powerful antioxidant, which helps to rejuvenate the liver and eliminate toxins. You can take it in capsules, sprinkle on food for food or add to hot drinks. 3. Cocoa Cocoa is high in flavonoids, or plant chemicals that are good for the heart and brain. It is said that consuming cocoa aids serotonin production in the brain. This feel-good chemical helps to regulate mood and suppress appetite. You can have a piece or two of dark chocolate as it contains high amount of cocoa. 4. Ajwain seeds Ajwain helps in digestion and absorption of food. Die to lesser fat storage, it ultimately leads to weight loss. All you need to do is to chew on a spoonful of carom seeds before breakfast. This process will make your body release enough digestive juices to help you digest the breakfast. 5. Oats CommentsOats are rich in fiber which helps you remain full and prevents binge-eating. Having oats for breakfast is one of the best ways to ensure you lose weight. Oats give you a fuller feeling as the fiber takes time to digest, thus preventing you from binging on other calorie high food.",

      "text": "April 11, 2660   SonicWall Defends Businesses, Users from Memory-Based Attacks and Zero-Day Malware, Including Malicious PDFs and Office Documents SonicWall Defends Businesses, Users from Memory-Based Attacks and Zero-Day Malware, Including Malicious PDFs and Office Documents Posted by Nisha on April 11, 2018 SonicWall, the trusted security partner protecting more than 1 million networks worldwide, expands the capabilities of the patent-pending SonicWall Real-Time Deep Memory Inspection(RTDMITM) technology to enhance protection against malicious PDFs and Microsoft Office files. A key component of the SonicWall Capture Cloud Platform, the SonicWall Capture Advanced Threat Protection(ATP) sandbox service, using RTDMI technology, identified more than 3,500 never-before-seen attack variants since January 1, 2018. “Cybercriminals are executing with extreme agility to exploit any and all vulnerabilities in both technology and user behavior,” said SonicWall President and CEO Bill Conner. “Memory regions are the next key battlegrounds where organizations will combat cybercriminals. If left unmitigated, they’ll leave a key attack vector vulnerable to new waves of modern cyberattacks.” First announced in February 2018, RTDMI technology is used by the SonicWall Capture Cloud Platform to identify and mitigate even the most insidious cyber threats, including memory-based attacks. RTDMI proactively detects and blocks unknown mass-market malware — including malicious PDFs and attacks leveraging Microsoft Office documents — via deep memory inspection in real time. “Attacks are leveraging sophisticated and proprietary encryption techniques to mask their attacks within memory,” said SonicWall CTO John Gmuender. “For this reason, organizations need to be proactive in identifying and mitigating attacks where weaponry only is exposed for up to 100 nanoseconds. More and more malware, ransomware and other advanced attacks will be delivered via this vector in the coming months and years.” The 2018 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report advises that cybercriminals will continue to leverage users’ trust in PDFs and Microsoft Office applications (which represented five of the top 10 attacked applications of 2017). Because of obfuscation techniques, many legacy firewalls and anti-virus solutions are unable to effectively identify and mitigate PDFs or Microsoft Office file types that contain malicious content. RTDMI is already operational for SonicWall customers with active subscriptions to SonicWall Capture ATP sandbox service and SonicWall Email Security solutions. Capture ATP, RTDMI Stop Malicious PDFs, Office Documents SonicWall RTDMI is a core multi-technology detection capability included in the SonicWall Capture ATP sandbox service. RTDMI identifies and blocks malware that may not exhibit any detectable malicious behavior or hides its weaponry via encryption. By forcing malware to reveal its weaponry into memory, RTDMI proactively stops mass-market, zero-day threats and unknown malware accurately utilizing real-time, memory-based inspection techniques. RTDMI also analyzes documents dynamically via proprietary exploit detection technology, along with static inspection, to detect many malicious document categories, including: Malicious Flash-based Microsoft Office documents Dynamic Data Exchange-based (DDE) exploits and malware inside Microsoft Office files Microsoft Office and PDF files containing malware or other malicious executables Malevolent shellcode-based and multi-layer files Macro-based malicious files PDF documents with “JavaScript infectors” JavaScript-based exploits in PDF documents Malicious, phishing-based PDF documents leading to both phishing and malware hosting websites Earlier this year, SonicWall Capture Labs threat researchers validated that the SonicWall RTDMI technology — specifically the technology’s real-time analysis of instruction and memory usage patterns — is effective against future exploits built on the Meltdown vulnerability. Meltdown, a processor vulnerability publicly announced by Google’s Project Zero security team in January 2018, could allow an attacker to access sensitive information (e.g., passwords, emails, documents) inside protected memory regions on modern processors. SonicWall Publishes Advanced Cyber Threat Data for SonicWall Customers and Partners To further aid organizations’ pursuit of protecting their data, networks, customers and brand, SonicWall launched the SonicWall Security Center with all-new, real-time threat meters to provide actionable cyberattack data and threat intelligence. The threat meters display ongoing attacks, as they happen, in locations around the world and maps them by origin. It tracks malware, intrusions, ransomware, encrypted threats, spam, phishing and emerging zero-day threats. Complementing the research in the 2018 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report, the SonicWall Security Center threat meters rank threat volumes and trends month-over-month and year-over-year, so organizations can make better-informed security decisions. The SonicWall Capture Cloud Platform identified more than 49,800 new attack variants in the first quarter of 2018, with the new SonicWall RTDMITM technology identifying 3,500 never-before-seen variants. In the first quarter of 2018 alone, the average SonicWall customer faced: 7,739 malware attacks, a year-over-year increase of 151 percent 173 ransomware attacks, a year-over-year increase of 226 percent 335 encrypted cyberattacks, a year-over-year increase of 430 percent 963 phishing attacks, a year-over-year increase of 15 percent “Organizations are better prepared to protect their networks and data if they know the volume and specific cyberattack types they are up against,” said Conner. “SonicWall will continue to arm customers and partners with actionable, real-time threat intelligence to help mitigate advanced attacks in the fast-moving cyber arms race.” The SonicWall Security Center gathers input from more than 1 million Capture Threat Network sensors worldwide, including active SonicWall firewalls, email security solutions, endpoint security devices, honeypots, content-filtering systems and multi‐engine Capture ATP sandbox environments.",

      "text": "By Mustafa Nadeem \nEpic Research \nThe Nifty50 had a flat session post a rally of 160 points in the last three days. On the charts, Nifty Future has formed a Doji indicating the indecision at the upper resistance levels. \nThe Nifty had a gap-up opening and attempted to pass through a major resistance level of 10450 but could not sustain at higher levels. It made of a low of 10392 and managed to close near the day's open at 10242.50. \nThe upthrust may sustain only if we can see closing above the resistance levels of 10450 levels. Thereafter, we may have gates opened for higher targets of 10550-10650. related news Podcast | Top five stocks which could give up to 17% return in short term \nOn the upside, 10650 is a very strong resistance. The Nifty had taken support at 10390 levels on Wednesday which indicates mild bullishness in the current case. \nThe volatility has gone down in the last 4 days. We have seen some major value picking at lower levels in midcaps and the largecaps. \nThe Nifty has bigger targets once we successfully close 10450 levels. Thereon, 10620/10640 are levels to watch out for in near term. This is where the stiff resistance would come. \nBroadly, if we cannot sustain at these levels then the downside is open to 9950 Levels from where Nifty reversed. The current short-term resistance comes at 10450-10460 levels whereas on the downside 10350-10150 are the major support levels. \nSrei Infrastructure Finance is rangebound on the daily chart with average volumes and trading at trend line resistance level on the daily chart. The RSI and CCI are also bullish on the hourly & daily chart. We recommend to buy from current level for the target of Rs 90 with the stop loss of Rs 82.

      "title": "Kerala custodial death: Mistaken identity behind Sreejith’s suspected killing; Human Rights Commission calls act ‘inhumane’",
      "text": "Tweet \nThe police in Kerala seem to be under the grips of a very malignant trend – to willfully resort to physical abuse with brute force on the citizens, and with every passing day, it seems to have no respite. \nThe suspected custodial death of 26-year-old Sreejith who was initially accused of trespassing and assault in Varapuzha in Kochi on Monday is the latest episode to rock the state's home department, which is presided over by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself. \nWhat makes matters worse is the news which had emerged when this copy was being filed that it was a case of mistaken identity and that the Sreejith, who allegedly died under police custody, was not the person against whom a family in Varapuzha had filed a police complaint. The mother and father of Sreejith, who was allegedly killed in police custody in Kerala. Firstpost/Naveen Nair \nOn Friday, 6 April, a group of 14 people had attacked the house of one 55-year-old Vasudevan over a local spat leading to his suicide a day later. But Vasudevan's son Vineesh said that the Sreejith who died under police custody was not among those who attacked his house. \n\"We have not registered any complaint against this particular Sreejith neither do we know whether he had any role in the attack on our house. Our complaint was against another Sreejith, who is the son of one Sasi. I have not even seen the Sreejith who died under police custody. No idea why the cops picked him up,\" Vineesh told Firstpost. \nThe presumably iron handed chief minister and his departmental top brass are now struggling to find answers to not just the alleged killing in police custody but also how an innocent young man got branded as a criminal and finally ended up in the cold mortuary of a government hospital. \nIt also throws the police version out of the window that the grave internal injuries suffered by Sreejith were from a scuffle at Vasudevan's house. If Sreejith was not present in Vasudevan's house, then who could have inflicted the wounds on him? Could it have happened while trying to get a confession out of Sreejith while in police custody? \nThe jury is still out as far as fixing the responsibility of Sreejith's death is concerned. But the events running up to his death has left a definite imprint of police excess. \nThis has forced the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) to file a suo motu case on the issue and condemn what it calls the barbarity of the force in unequivocal terms. \n\"This is an absolutely inhumane act. Just because you wear the uniform does not mean you cannot be humane. I had personally visited the hospital and talked to the doctor who treated Sreejith. The doctor clearly said that 75 percent of Sreejith's small intestine or the jejunum had been ruptured, forcing whatever food he ate to spill into other body parts leading to septicemia. Such an injury can only be caused by extreme force in the abdominal region. This is a clear case of custodial torture,\" said P Mohana Das, acting chairperson of the Kerala State Human Rights Commission (KSHRC). \nThe commission is not alone in pointing fingers at the men in khaki (police uniform). Sreejith's family said in one voice that the police had used brute force on the young man. \nShyamala, Sreejith's mother is unable to hide her tears as she recounts the events of Friday night when a police team picked up Sreejith from his home without even saying what wrong he had done. \n\"They beat him and kicked him in front of us when they came to take him into custody. From then on, we were scared that something will happen to him. Later on, when I went to the station the next morning, I saw him sitting on the bench clutching his tummy. He even asked me water. I tried to give it to him but the inspector did not allow it. Later on, we were told that he was in the hospital. I am certain the cops killed my son,\" a wailing Shyamala said. \nViolations all the way \nThe postmortem report which was out by Tuesday evening clearly states that Sreejith had died due to septicemia, developed after his intestines had ruptured following intense pressure on his abdomen or in medical parlance 'blunt trauma to abdomen' – something that will make it very tough for the cops to wriggle out of the case. The report had also suggested that the cause of death was cardiac arrest due to immense stress. \nThe SHRC, which had asked the state director general of police (DGP) to file a report at the earliest had also pointed out the gross violation of Supreme Court guidelines by the policemen while taking Sreejith into custody. \nFor starters, there is no clarity when or whether Sreejith's arrest was ever recorded. He was picked up around 10:45 pm on Friday and till he was taken to the hospital in the wee hours of Sunday morning with acute pain in the abdomen, police had kept Sreejith inside the station – a detention of well over 24 hours without an arrest, as per the findings of the Commission. \n\"This is a clear case of violation of all possible norms which need to be followed when an individual is taken into police custody. Why did the police not take him to a hospital for medical examination, something that needs to be done before an arrest? Why were his relatives not informed about his condition if at all they were planning to arrest him? And above all, why did they not produce him before a magistrate even after 24 hours? So, it is an illegal detention which is a violation of basic human rights,\" the commission pointed out. \nMeanwhile, a visibly shaken DGP who met media persons at Thiruvananthapuram has said that the case is a very serious and would be probed by a Special Investigation Team (SIT). \n\"I have complete empathy for the mother of Sreejith and what she has said. It is a very serious allegation against the police which will be investigated threadbare by a team that has a track record of very high credibility. We will get to the bottom of this and will not spare anyone,\" said Lokanath Behera, DGP, Kerala Police. \nThe police, meanwhile, is doing everything it can to counter the claim of mistaken identity. It even brought up a counter-claim late into Tuesday evening that Vineesh's statement was recorded in the presence of Sreejth and that Vineesh had identified him as well, something which the latter said is baseless. \nPolitical fallouts \nThe political ramifications of Sreejith's custodial death could be highly damaging for the ruling Left Front. For one, he is a BJP local worker and secondly, as of now, he seems innocent having nothing to do with the crime that he has been accused of. \nWith the Chengannur bypolls to be held soon, the BJP will for sure make this an election issue. \n\"Obviously, this will be an election issue in Chengannur. The people should know the real face of Vijayan and his police. Never in the history of the state has a situation come where a junior officer and policemen do whatever they want in spite of the DGP's orders for restraint. It shows that police stations across Kerala are run by local CPM leaders who are Vijayan's men and not by the system. This is atrocious,\" MS Kumar, state BJP spokesperson, said. \nBJP's allegations find echo inside the CPM as well. In the last state conference of the party at Thrissur, Vijayan, considered the numero uno in the party, himself took tremendous flak for the way the home ministry had been conducting itself. \nEven inside the Left Front, the coalition partners have been highly critical of the conduct of the men in uniform and the inability of the chief minister to successfully apply the Left's policy of governance in the home department. But nothing has changed since then, nor anyone has raised dissent to the police's functioning. \n\"See, not just in the CPM's state conference but even in the CPI state conference there was strong criticism from within the party on how the home department was being run. But the issue here is who will bell the cat? Vijayan is still the omnipotent force who has created a structure in the party where hardly a voice is raised against his style of functioning. Even the CPI, apart from making a few noises, shies away from an open debate. Add to this the gross inefficiency of Vijayan as an administrator, you have this terrible state of affairs,\" Joseph C Mathew, noted political commentator told Firstpost. \nThe Congress too is on a war path regarding the police excesses in the state. Thrice the party-led Opposition had stalled the state Assembly over various issues related to the state police's excesses, forcing the chief minister to concede on more than one occasion that that the police had indeed gone overboard with their highhandedness. \n\"Since this government came to power, police brutality has become the order of the day. But hardly any action has been taken. That is why the Congress party strongly feels that the need of the hour is to investigate Sreejith's death with help of an independent agency. There is no trust in a police investigation,\" said VD Satheesan, vice-president of the Congress party in Kerala. \nThe latest update in the case is that three policemen, who had gone to take Sreejith into custody, have been suspended. This raises the suspicion whether the action was being taken against the cops for taking into custody the wrong person and is the police finally acknowledging that a mistake was made? \nThat no action has been taken against the sub-inspector or others present in the station while he was allegedly tortured is being explained with the excuse of an ongoing investigation. \nOne will have to wait for the detailed investigation to start to see in which direction this case will go. \nPublished Date: Apr 11, 2018 11:55 AM | Updated Date: Apr 11, 2018 11:55 AM Tags : #ConnectTheDots #CPI #CPM #Custodial Death #Custodial Killing #Human Rights #Kerala #Kerala Police #Left Front #Pinarayi Vijayan #SHRC #Sreejith #Thiruvananthapuram Also See",

      "text": "Tweet \nDismissing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking the framing of guidelines for allocation of cases, the Supreme Court has declared that the Chief Justice of India (CJI) is an institution himself and cannot be distrusted. The petition asked the court to frame guidelines for rational and transparent allocation of cases and constitution of benches to hear them. \nCalling the petition scandalous, the court said that the CJI is the highest authority in the court and cannot be distrusted, reported NDTV . The court said that the CJI is the first among equals and has authority to decide allocation of cases and setting up of benches. \nThe judgment was delivered by a bench comprising CJI Dipak Misra, Justice AM Khanwilkar and Justice DY Chandrachud. The petition was filed by Ashok Pande, a Lucknow resident who had asked that Constitution benches constituted by the Supreme Court should comprise the five senior-most judges, according to Hindustan Times . He had also asked for specialised benches to hear matters pertaining to PILs, tax, criminal, land and service matters. \nThe peition also asked the CJI should consult the two senior-most judges while allocating work, reported The Times of India . \n“Unfettered power is being exercised by the Chief Justices in the matter of formation of Benches, and so, the same is liable to be regulated through specific rules,” the petition said, according to The Hindu . It also asked that the three-judge bench in the CJI's court should consist only of the CJI and the court's two senior-most judges. \nThe PIL was filed in the backdrop of the 12 January press conference held by senior-most apex court judges including Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur and Kurian Joseph. File image of the Supreme Court of India. Reuters \nAnother petition on a similar issue had been filed by Shanti Bhushan but that is still pending before the court. Bhushan had sought direction that the exercise of authority as a master of roster by the Chief Justice of India in allocating the cases to different benches should be done in consultation with senior judges who are part of top court collegium. \nIn his PIL, he said that the authority of Chief Justice of India as a master of roster is not an \"absolute, arbitrary, singular power\" which may be exercised in his \"sole discretion\" and the CJI \"must\" exercise his authority in consultation with other senior judges who are also part of collegiums. \nPointing to the \"extremely disturbing trend\" of listing matters \"subjectively and selectively\" only before certain benches, the PIL says that trend reflects \"serious erosion of independence of the judiciary\" by resorting to the method of \"favoured listings\". \"As a result, justice appears to be skewed and in many cases justice may even stand denied,\" it said. It has said that the powers being exercised by the Chief Justice and the concerned Registry officials clearly reflect a \"pattern of favouritism, nepotism and forum shopping\". \nThough the listing of politically sensitive matters appears to be \"routine\", they seem designed in a particular direction to exclude other benches from hearing them, it said. \nDescribing such selective listing as \"unwarranted and unjustified\", the PIL says that \"such listings and/or allocations are not happening on account of computer allocation but appears due to human interference in the system\". \nWith inputs from agencies \nPublished Date: Apr 11, 2018 11:16 AM | Updated Date: Apr 11, 2018 12:49 PM",

      "text": "Apr 11, 2018 10:28 AM IST | Source: Moneycontrol.com Expect strong FY19 for agrochemical cos, 5 stocks that can give up to 53% return Brokerages expect a positive FY19 for agrochemical sector on the back of government's intent to double farm incomes and a normal monsoon More × \nAgrochemical companies are expected to report a 6-10 percent sales growth for the quarter ending March 2018 but high raw material prices may put pressure on margins, research firms suggest. \nOverall, the performance of such companies is expected to be good even though it is a seasonally a weak quarter. \"Aggregate revenue of domestic companies is likely to increase by 10 percent YoY. Overall revenue growth (including exports) is estimated at 25 percent YoY, driven by a 16 percent YoY growth each in Bayer CropSciences (due to a lower base) and PI Industries (due to ramp-up in execution of its CRAMS business),\" Emkay Research said. \nAccording to Edelweiss, the domestic agrochemical industry may post moderate 6-8 percent sales growth whereas agrochemical universe (ex-UPL and Bayer Cropscience) may post 17 percent YoY growth led by PI Industries (post recovery in CSM) and Sharda Cropchem, while Rallis would gain from low base. \nEmkay said interaction with managements suggest that the prices of key raw materials continue to remain higher, which would adversely impact EBITDA margins in Q4FY18. However, integrated players will witness improvement in margins. related news JK Tyre Q4 PAT may dip 41.4% YoY to Rs 52 cr: ICICI Direct \nThe agency expects aggregate EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) to grow by 9 percent YoY while EBITDA margin is likely to contract by modest 40bps due to improvement in margins for integrated player Insecticides India and steady margins for UPL . \nElara Capital also feels the EBITDA across agrochemicals universe is expected to grow nearly 9 percent YoY in Q4FY18 on the back of margin erosion. \n\"While Dhanuka Agritech is expected to report an EBITDA of Rs 26.7 crore with margin of 16 percent, UPL is likely to post EBITDA of Rs 1,126.5 crore with margin of 19 percent. PI Industries and Rallis are likely to report an EBITDA growth of 9.3 percent YoY and 6.1 percent YoY, respectively,\" it said. \nEdelweiss expect Rallis to extend its growth trend of Q3FY18 as it expects the sales push to continue, along with a lower base, and hence factor in 16 percent YoY growth. \"Dhanuka Agritech is expected to report a stable quarter. For Bayer, we estimate revenue to normalise (up 80 percent YoY) on an exceptionally bad Q4FY17. We estimate UPL to post strong growth in North America (11 percent YoY growth in revenues) in-line with the company’s guidance.\" \nDespite moderate growth in Q4, all brokerage houses are positive on agrochemical sector on hopes of strong performance in FY19 due to government's intent to double farm incomes and expected normal monsoon. \nAccording to weather forecaster Skymet, monsoon is likely to remain normal at 100 percent (with an error margin of +/-5%) of the long period average (LPA) of 887mm from June to September. \nElara Capital expects ramp-up in Kharif sowing for FY19, following good monsoon. Also, expected hikes in MSP rates are likely to bring in improved expectations for farm income. Higher acreage and yield on the back of improved farmers’ sentiments coupled with recovery in farm income are likely to bolster growth in the agrochemicals business for FY19, it said. \nEdelweiss also expects agri input players to report strong growth in FY19, especially after this year’s Kharif season hit by GST. In irrigation, higher funds allocation by government will support growth. Falling subsidy and DBT implementation brighten prospects of fertiliser companies, it said. \nInsecticides India and UPL remain top picks of Emkay Research due to their better product mix and healthy product placements, high degree of backward integration and resilient business models. Also, the recent correction in their stock prices offers good entry point. The research house also likes Dhanuka Agritech due to compelling valuation. \nEdelweiss also likes Dhanuka Agritech while Elara Capital said UPL and Rallis are its top picks. \nHere are Emkay's top five agrochemical stocks that can give up to 53 percent return: \nDhanuka Agritech | Rating - Buy | Target - Rs 847 | Return - 44% \nWe estimate 4 percent YoY revenue growth, as we anticipate moderate sales across segments. Sales of Cover, Sempra and Sakura are likely to remain steady. EBITDA margin could decline by 260bps to 19.0 percent due to higher raw material (RM) prices. We estimate PAT to drop by 13 percent YoY. \nInsecticides India | Rating - Buy | Target - Rs 1,150 | Return - 53% \nRevenue growth of 7.3 percent YoY will be primarily driven by strong performance in the Technical segment, as we anticipate higher production of Byspyribac Sodium (Green Lebel). We expect margin improvement of 232bps YoY to 9.9 percent, resulting in 40.1 percent YoY growth in EBITDA. PAT growth is estimated at 16.2 percent YoY. \nPI Industries | Rating - Buy | Target - Rs 1,028 | Return - 15% \nWe estimate 16 percent YoY increase in revenue, mainly driven by CSM business (to register 20 percent YoY growth). Margin is likely to decrease by 250bps to 22.8 percent, primarily due to elevated RM prices. Adjusted profit after tax (adjusted for forex impact) is estimated to be at Rs 110 crore, down 11.8 percent YoY. At USD 1 billion, order book position is likely to remain at the similar level as Q3FY18. \nSharda Cropchem | Rating - Accumulate | Target - Rs 494 | Return - 22% We estimate revenue growth of 15 percent YoY. Margin is likely to remain under pressure at 24 percent, as prices of chemicals have increased in China post shutdown of many facilities. We\nestimate PAT growth of 4.1 percent YoY. New registrations will be key driver of revenue growth. Demand environment in Europe & Latin America will be the key to watch out for. \nUPL | Rating - Buy | Target - Rs 997 | Return - 32% \nDomestic segment is likely to post 5 percent YoY revenue growth while we estimate Latin America to grow by 8 percent YoY, primarily due to healthy Soybean sowing. Europe is expected to register revenue growth of 9 percent YoY due to bumper Sugar Beet crop. \nWe estimate an overall revenue growth of 8.7 percent YoY, primarily driven by increased volume in the key regions of North America, Latin America and Europe. We estimate 6 percent YoY EBITDA growth with 58bps contraction in margins to 20.5 percent.

      "text": "New 2018 Ford Focus unveiled as brand's ‘most advanced’ model in Europe \nby Matt Prior, Autocar UK Apr 11, 2018 The Focus is up to 88kg lighter than it was but 20% stiffer overall New C2 platform adds 53mm to the wheelbase and boosts cabin space Ford Focus Active interior The upmarket Ford Focus Vignale Ford Focus ST-Line Ford Focus Estate (left) and Vignale Ford Focus Active ST-Line trim lowers the car by 15mm and adds a more sporty look New tech will make the Focus Ford’s most advanced car in Europe Ford Focus Estate Ford Focus ST-Line \nFord said it has retained driving engagement as a key priority for the new Focus, the fourth-generation version of the small family hatchback that redefined the company’s attitude to dynamic ability when it was launched in 1998. \nThe new Focus, due on sale in July, will come in two body styles in the UK: five-door hatchback and estate. A saloon will remain on sale on the Continent. There will be four trim variations and Ford said a raft of new technology will make the Focus the most advanced car it sells in Europe. \nSpeaking at the launch of the new Focus in London, Ford's European boss, Steven Armstrong, said: \"The new Focus is, quite simply, the best car in our 114-year history.\" \nBeyond that, however, the agility that has made the Focus so popular to date will remain. Joe Bakaj, Ford Europe’s vice president for product development, said: “Driving quality in itself isn’t enough to sell cars. If you’re not up to scratch [in infotainment], you’re not even considered. But owners will still get that fun-to-drive feel that people have loved about the Focus for the past 20 years.” \nThe hatchback will be offered with ST-Line trim, which has suspensions that are 10mm lower than the standard car’s, and as an Active-badged near-crossover variant, which sits 30mm higher than standard. Ford’s upmarket Vignale specification will also be offered, along with the regular Titanium trim level. \nAside from otherwise consistent interior architecture, the Active version will feature some harder-wearing materials, Vignale cars will receive more upmarket trim with more satin materials and ST-Line models will be more sporty. Regular Titanium versions will sit somewhere between them. \nFord hasn’t yet announced pricing, but a small percentage increase is expected over the current model, which suggests a car that will sell from £20,500 (Rs 18.9 lakh) through to around £28,000 (Rs 25.8 lakh). \nA hot ST version will follow and although there has been no official confirmation of a high-performance RS model, Autocar understands there will be one with a 400bhp, 425lb ft mild-hybrid powertrain. \nThe latest Focus is built on a highly adaptable new Ford platform, called C2, which will underpin dozens of medium-sized forthcoming models, including the next-generation Kuga SUV. By 2021, Ford expects C-segment SUV and crossover sales to outstrip those of regular models. \nFord estimates that by the middle of the next decade, the European markets for mid-sized SUVs and cars will be roughly 3.5 million units apiece. The enduring popularity of C-segment cars, which currently make up 19% of all cars sold in Europe, is one reason why Ford – unlike GM, which dispensed with its European Vauxhall/Opel arm – remains committed here. \n“We’d find it daft to exit a big market like Europe,” said Bakaj. “Seventeen million cars a year are sold here. And it’s a net contributor to the business in terms of engineering and development.” \nThe Focus and its C2 platform have largely been developed in Europe. The new model is a crucial part of the successful ‘One Ford’ plan that means Fords built on the same platform are sold in multiple regions: Europe’s Mondeo is the US Fusion and the Mk3 Focus RS was sold globally. \nThe Focus’s new platform is said to liberate interior room in a package little bigger than today’s model. The wheelbase is 53mm longer, at 2701mm, while the overall length is only 18mm longer (now 4378mm, pretty normal for the class). The width is about the same, at 1820mm, and the new car is 15mm lower than before. \nIt’s also lighter than today’s Focus. Ford hasn’t confirmed kerb weights yet because final homologation hasn’t been completed, but it says the new car is up to 88kg lighter, like-for-like, then today’s Focus. Some 33kg of that comes from the chassis, which uses a greater proportion of high-strength steel and a few aluminium elements in the front crash structure. Overall, body rigidity is up by 20%, but this increases by as much as 50% around the suspension elements, which, Ford says, allows it much more flexibility in suspension tuning. The body panels are 25kg lighter than those of the previous Focus, the interior loses 17kg and the powertrain and electrical systems each lose up to 6kg and 7kg respectively. \nAt launch, there will be a line-up of pure diesel and petrol engines, with a mild hybrid to follow next year. Initially, petrol engines are familiar three-cylinder Ecoboost units, adapted for improved economy. The 1.0-litre triple has a new turbocharger and cylinder head, a higher compression ratio (now 10.5:1) and increased injection pressure (250bar), and it has a petrol particulate filter. \nIt comes with power outputs of 84bhp, 99bhp and 124bhp, each with estimated CO2 emissions of 108g/km. \nA development of the Fiesta ST’s three-cylinder 1.5-litre petrol will also be offered with the Focus. It includes cylinder deactivation and will come in 148bhp and 179bhp forms, offering CO2 outputs of 120g/km or thereabouts. \nThere will be two Ecoblue- badged four-cylinder diesels. The 1.5 comes in 94bhp and 118bhp forms and produces from 94g/km of CO2, while the 2.0-litre makes 148bhp and emits about 110g/km. \nAll will drive through a six-speed manual transmission or, optionally on the highest-powered petrol of each size, the top-spec 1.5-litre diesel and the 2.0-litre diesel, an eight-speed automatic. It’s a conventional torque-converter auto rather than a dual-clutch unit, following an industry trend towards smoother conventional auto gearboxes. \nFord now expects the 1.0-litre petrol to be the biggest-selling variant, taking over from the 1.5-litre diesel. \nUnusually for a Focus, the chassis set-up will depend on which engine is specified. The 1.0 petrol and 1.5 diesel will get a twist beam rear axle. Bakaj believes this will give driving characteristics “just as good as today’s Focus”, which has a fully independent rear end. The current Focus has been the benchmark for the new car’s twist-beam: Bakaj says potholes thump a bit more with the torsion beam, but otherwise, you’d be hard-pressed to notice the difference between the two. \nHigher-spec Focuses will get an independent rear end, in the form of a rear double-wishbone set-up that is meant to further improve comfort. But it’s standard only on 1.5 petrol or 2.0-litre diesel models, on the Active crossover, on the estate and on Vignale versions. \nThe ST-Line, with its lower suspension and stiffer bushes (on double-wishbone versions), is “the car that delivers on the Focus promise more than any other”, in the words of Bakaj. That promise includes a turning centre that feels like it’s adjacent to the driver, to give one of the most agile feelings in the class and a rear end that ‘tucks’ on turn-in with a lift of the throttle. \nAll Focuses get three driving modes, which will affect the steering weight, automatic gearbox operation (if fitted) and throttle map. The modes will also adjust the adaptive dampers that are offered as an option on cars with double-wishbone suspension. \nThe estate’s suspension uses lower and wider dampers to increase the luggage volume to the extent that there’s a width of 1.14m between the wheelhouses – 12cm more than any rival car, according to Ford. The overall load length is up by 134mm, to 1700mm with the rear seats folded. With the seats in place, the load area can be covered by a tonneau that can be operated one-handed. There’s additional storage space beneath the boot floor. \nThanks to the wheelbase extension, the Focus’s interior dimensions are said to be vastly improved despite the only modest increase in external girth. Rear knee room is up by 56mm, front shoulder room is said to be class-leading and, thanks to a reprofiling of the rear doors, rear passengers’ heads are now adjacent to the glass rather than metal, so they can see out more easily. \nStructural changes aside, some of the Focus’s extra interior space has been created by making the windscreen more upright. That reduces the depth of the instrument panel, which has 50% fewer buttons owing to a complete redesign of the multimedia systems. \nFord says the Focus will be the most advanced car it sells in Europe. It will have radar- operated cruise control and the lane-keep assist to level two autonomous standards, emergency auto braking, park assist, rear cross-traffic alert and, significantly for passengers, a wi-fi network that will connect to up to 10 devices and work up to 15m away from the car. \nMild-hybrid Focus here next year \nAlthough it’s disappointing that a hybrid variant of the Focus Mk4 hasn’t been announced at launch, Ford has at least confirmed that a mild hybrid is on its way. \nNext year, a 1.0-litre Ecoboost engine will be mated to an electric motor, via a 48V electrical system, which is becoming the norm for adding boost and reducing emissions, but it doesn’t offer prolonged fuel-free running or plug-in charging. Instead, a lower-capacity battery than that of a true hybrid stores energy, generated under deceleration via a starter/generator, to help power the car in town or fill a low-end torque gap. \nIt’s natural to assume that the Focus mild hybrid’s chief rival will not be Volkswagen’s Golf GTE, which has a 101bhp electric motor combined with a 148bhp 1.4-litre petrol engine, but instead a mild- hybrid version, which has yet to join the Golf range. \nFord’s Joe Bakaj said the Focus’s 1.0/48V system will have a similar CO2 output to that of the high-powered diesel with an auto gearbox, so around 110g/km, then. \nThe complexity of making a clean modern diesel, plus the slowly reducing battery costs for hybrids, means that a mild hybrid is “starting to get to the same cost” as a diesel, said Bakaj. \nBut the two offer different things, and a diesel still can’t be touched for a long-distance economy. “It’d be a real shame if society turns away and we can’t sell diesels,” Bakaj added.",

      "text": "Its worst addictions and how cure them IT’s worst addictions and how to cure them \nAre you a control freak? A data fiend? An infrastructure junkie? Your tech addictions may be bringing your company down. Here's how to go cold turkey. Dan Tynan Apr 11th 2018 \nEverybody has bad habits, but sometimes they can turn into compulsions. \nWhile technology addiction is a real thing, especially for teenagers, IT pros have their own monkeys on their backs. \nWhether you're an infrastructure junkie or a Slack head, chasing the data dragon or mesmerized by the blinking lights on your network operations center dashboard, your tech addictions can kill productivity, sap budgets and stall innovation. \nAn inability to relinquish control can lead to technology silos and turf wars. Overdependence on artificial intelligence can actually hurt, not help, your company. And while everyone loves shiny new toys, they may not be the most cost-effective solutions for your organization. The first step on the road to recovery is admitting you have a problem. The next step is reading our prescriptions for how to kick your bad habits and get clean again. IT addiction No. 1: Data \nBecause data drives nearly every business decision, it's easy to understand why the corporate appetite for it is insatiable. But collecting data just because you can, without a plan for how to use it effectively, can be worse than collecting no data at all. \nAccording to surveys conducted by Square Root, employees spend more than 20 hours a week collecting and analyzing data, but more than 40 percent of organizations aren't putting that data to use. \n\"Organizations are caught in analysis paralysis,\" says Sarah Kampman, vice president of product at Square Root, whose CoEfficient SaaS platform helps retailers and automotive brands make sense of their data. \"The information isn't translating into behavioral changes that drive success.\" \nInstead of focusing on big data, companies would do better to zero in on the small data that's more relevant to their mission. Kampman says it starts with having a single source of truth that every part of the organization can draw on. \n\"Collecting your enterprise data in a multi-petabyte pile will not magically transform your organization into a lean, hyper-performing data-mining company,\" agrees Mike Meikle, partner in SecureHIM, a consulting firm that specializes in healthcare information management and security. \"Data is valuable, yes, but knowing what to keep, how to use it and who manages it is just as critical.\" \nThe cure: You don't need to go cold turkey on data, but you do need to be more selective about what you do with it. Identify data that's truly critical to business decisions, clean and de-dupe it, and discard what you don't need, says Meikle. IT addiction No. 2: AI \nLike big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning are buzzwords du jour. The thinking goes like this: You collect a huge pool of data, run it through some machine learning models, and voila — instant business insights. \nWell, not exactly. Despite what you may have read, AI is not the solution to every problem, notes Cristian Rennella, co-founder and CIO of oMelhorTrato, a financial services marketplace based in Brazil. \nAfter nine years of having its HR department answer employee questions via live chat and phone calls, it started to develop its own AI-driven chatbot using Google's TensorFlow platform. \nIt was a great success, says Rennella. The company was able to automate responses to 67 percent of all questions, and improved employee productivity by 24 percent. The AI chatbot proved equally useful for automating sales queries. \nBut when they tried to apply AI to marketing, it was a disaster, he says. AI was unable to easily segment the company's client base, and conversions were 35 percent lower. \n\"We learned that not everything can be optimized with AI,\" he says. \"We were never able to achieve the same level of success that we had with person-to-person relationships.\" \nThe cure: Before you go all in on AI solutions, run small pilots first to see how successful it's likely to be for each use case, says Rennella. IT addiction No. 3: Infrastructure \nMany CIOs who've spent the majority of their careers managing data centers and the people who run them are often unable or unwilling to let go. For them, infrastructure is literally addicting, says Chandra Sekar, vice president of marketing at Avi Networks, a cloud-based application delivery platform. \n\"The whir of fans and blinking lights gave people a sense of control and power,\" he says. \"As you'd walk past rows of servers, load balancers, firewalls and switches in the data center, you couldn't help but keep a tally in your head. If you had more servers and appliances, you knew you were at the better company. Hardware was an addiction.\" \nSekar, who calls himself a “recovering engineer,” says he overcame his addiction when he began working for companies that embraced cloud computing. \n\"Cloud migration is one of the biggest trends in enterprise IT, but not all IT pros have been able to let go of their addiction to hardware appliances,\" he says. \"Holding onto a hardware-centric view instead of an application-centric one slows down a company's ability to innovate and thrive.\" \nThe cure: Think more deliberately about what apps and services truly need to be on premises, and put the rest in the cloud. This will free up CIOs to think more strategically about the business, says Doug Bordonaro, chief data evangelist at ThoughtSpot, a “human-scale” analytics firm. \n\"CIOs spend too much time on infrastructure, and not enough time on future-proofing the business,\" he says. \"They need to break the infrastructure addiction and spend more time investing in and monetizing data programs, or equipping staff with cutting-edge skills.\" IT addiction No. 4: Slack \nOf all the real-time always-on business communication tools, Slack has found a particular niche in the world of tech. And so has Slack addiction. \nThe problem is that organizations can become so reliant on the chat tool that it becomes the dominant form of communication. People end up spending more time Slacking than working. \nDave Teare, co-founder and CTO of AgileBits, makers of 1Password, knows this well. Two years ago he wrote a post on his company's blog about how its increasing dependence on Slack had become more harmful than helpful. \n\"Slowly but surely this addiction has been killing my sanity and sapping our productivity as we simply used Slack for too many things,\" he wrote. \nWhen AgileBits first started using Slack, everyone loved it. Before long, the company's 60 employees had created 81 public Slack channels. Any time employees had a question, Slack was the first place they went, even when better options like internal wikis and knowledge bases were available. \nBut the more conversations that were spawned, the less likely it became to have a detailed, in-depth discussion about anything. \n\"The thing is, being connected doesn't magically enable effective communication,\" Teare wrote. \nTeare says he found himself trying desperately to keep up with all the Slack conversations going on in his company and growing more curt in his responses, before he finally decided to pull the plug for a while. \nWhen AgileBits returned to Slack a few weeks later, it had established new rules: keep channels more focused, invite fewer team members to each discussion, and use it only for ephemeral chats, explains Jeff Shiner, the company's CEO (chief eliminator of obstacles). When a discussion needs to saved or archived, AgileBits uses other tools like Workplace. \n\"People lose the ability to communicate properly when they rely on any form of technology as the sole means of communication,\" says Jimmy Carroll, a partner and director at TetraVX, which makes communication and collaboration technology. \"Things take a lot longer to accomplish.\" \nThe cure: Create rules around Slack and other forms of corporate communication. For example, encourage employees to use video chat to resolve problems, or require them to pick up the phone and talk if an email string goes on beyond a handful of back and forth messages, says Carroll. \n\"But this has to come from the top down,\" he says. \"You need to establish procedures to protect your employees from themselves.\" IT addiction No. 5: Control \nAs more businesses evolve into digital-first organizations, some IT pros instinctively move to protect their turf by hoarding knowledge and establishing mini-fiefdoms. They're addicted to having control over their domains of expertise. \nYou know you have a problem when your IT shop starts to resemble Game of Thrones, says Meikle. \n\"Each manager fights over control of their area, quickly dispatching foes who ask pointed questions about critical systems,\" he says. \"Your staff zealously guards access and knowledge of your fiefdom. Budgets, processes, staffing levels are all opaque and you rant about how the business customers are idiots.\" \nThe emergence of new C-suite entrants like chief digital officer, chief experience officer, or chief marketing technology officer creates even greater potential for turf wars, as each hopes to carve out their own pieces of the technology pie. \nEveryone looking out for their own agendas is a recipe for disaster, says Scott Kitlinski, CIO and vice president of managed services for Astadia, a cloud consultancy. \n\"They all play different roles that should fit together synergistically,\" he says. \"They're better off teaming up, and whose budget dollars end up where should be a moot point. It's really about who is going to play what role to spend those dollars in the interest of the organization.\" \nThe cure: Give up the illusion of control and embrace sharing and transparency, says Meikle. \n\"You need to move from hoarding knowledge to sharing it,\" he says. \"Reward your staff for sharing information and assisting others. Put processes in place to create transparency in how the IT department functions.\" IT addiction No. 6: Blinking lights \nScience has shown that every time your phone pings, a tiny jolt of dopamine goes coursing through your brain. But notifications are just as addictive for techs glued to dashboards, eagerly awaiting the next blinking light. \n\"We all have that one thing we compulsively check,\" says Leon Adato, head geek for SolarWinds, makers of infrastructure management software. \"It could be the NOC dashboard, it could be the performance tracker for your 'baby' system, it could be cloud statistics. For many, it's the monitoring dashboard.\" \nConstant random notifications hijack your attention, depleting your ability to do productive work, says Prince Ghuman, a professor of neuro marketing, communications, and entrepreneurship at the Hult International Business School. \n\"We have a limited attention span, and our willpower is also limited,\" says Ghuman, who's co-authoring a book on digital addiction. \"Every time that you give in to a notification, your willpower is being depleted. If you deplete that willpower early on in the day, you're more likely to make worse decisions later on in the day.\" \nYou know you're addicted to notifications when you realize they're keeping you from your work, says Adato. If you feel guilty about how much time you spend obsessing over dashboards, that's a clear sign. \nThe cure: IT pros need to be more disciplined about how they spend their time, says Adato. Use tools that let you identify and filter important notifications from the rest, and set limits on how much time you spend checking screens instead of getting actual work done. IT addiction No. 7: Shiny new objects \nEverybody loves new toys. But when it results in closets full of unused hardware and licenses for software that time has forgotten, you've got a problem. \n\"There's a beautiful fixation that we all have with what I call the shiny, bouncy ball syndrome,\" says Ingrid Lindberg, founder of Chief Customer, a customer experience marketing firm. \"What do we need to build next? What do we need to do next? What do we need to sell next? And the thing I've found that has the most impact for customers is, Are you actually just meeting the basics? Are you making it easier for them to do things?\" \nThe latest hardware or software is not a panacea for solving your most critical IT issues, notes Meikle. \n\"Remember the business triangle — people, process, and technology?\" he asks. \"People and process are equally if not more important than all the hardware and software in your arsenal.\" \nThe cure: Instead of purchasing the latest shiny object, Meikle suggests taking that money and applying it to training the people who work for you. Build a team to manage your projects. And make sure there's a clear business justification for every major purchase. \n\"When you don't know the business justification for spending dollars on an IT asset, then you need to step away from the glossy trade rags and get back to the basics.\" Related Feature",

The index is trading very narrow and choppy from last three trading days. In these three trading days, two were the NR7 (narrowest range in last seven trading days). These patterns indicate a big and thrusting move should come in either direction. We have to understand that there may be sudden market dips, but the up move is likely to continue, therefore, the dips should be used as buying opportunities.\nThe index continued trading very narrow. Last three days were very narrow. The index has made two NR7 pattern in last three trading days suggests the current phase which is contraction.

The increases are effective from April 1. “This hike reflects the increase in our cost of funds since October. Between July 2017 and now, ten year government bond yields have risen 100 basis points.

      "text": "Mahindra Defence Systems is committed to absorb the technology for the large amphibious aircraft in India, he said. \nThe MoU envisages both the companies to build up a strategic partnership, Kawanishi said. \n2:50 pm Europe Lower: Equities in Europe moved lower as investors began to focus on earnings at the start of a new reporting season. \nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 was 0.21 percent lower with most sectors trading in negative territory. \n2:44 am Market Update: The market continued to consolidate after four-day rally, as investors await corporate earnings which will start later in the week and macro data due tomorrow. \nThe market digested higher crude oil prices that hit four-year high. Brent crude oil price is trading above USD 70 a barrel. \nThe 30-share BSE Sensex is up 52.97 points at 33,933.22   8.20 points at 10,410.50. \nPSU Bank is the biggest loser among sectoral indices, falling 2 percent while IT and Metal indices continued to trade higher by 1 percent each. \nOil retailers are biggest losers among Nifty50 stocks, falling 7 percent. \n2:30 pm Digital Transformation: Digital transformation in the country is expected to contribute about USD 154 billion to India's GDP by 2021, tech giant Microsoft today said. \nThe study by Microsoft and IDC, titled “Unlocking the economic impact of digital transformation in Asia Pacific\", said there has been a dramatic acceleration in the pace of digital transformation across India and Asia-Pacific economies. \n\"In 2017, about 4 percent of India's GDP was derived from digital products and services created directly through the use of digital technologies like mobility, cloud, internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence (AI),\" Microsoft India President Anant Maheshwari told reporters here. \nHe added that within the next four years, it is estimated that nearly 60 per cent of India's GDP will have a strong connection to the digital transformation trends. \n2:16 pm Inflation Poll : Indian retail inflation was expected to have eased to a five-month low in March as increases in food prices slowed once again but remained above the central bank's medium-term target, a Reuters poll found. \nThat, coupled with the latest data which showed Asia's third-largest economy beat China to regain top spot as the fastest growing major economy. That should give policymakers some relief as they seek to keep inflation under control without hurting growth. \nAnnual consumer price inflation was expected to have softened to 4.20 percent in March from February's 4.44 percent, according to a poll of 35 economists taken April 4-10. \nForecasts ranged from 3.90 to 5.10 percent. \nIf the consensus matches the actual release, it would be the smallest annual increase in retail prices since October. It would also mark the third consecutive month of easing after hitting a 17-month high in December. \n2:02 pm Rating Downgrade : Ratings agency ICRA has downgraded Fortis Healthcare and its subsidiaries Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, Fortis Hospitals and Hiranandani Healthcare, citing stretched liquidity position of the company which led to delay in servicing of a loan. \nThe long term rating of Fortis Healthcare Ltd (FHL) for Rs 250 crore non-convertible debenture programme, Rs 105 crore fund-based limits, and Rs 195 crore term loans has been revised to 'C' from BBB, ICRA said in a statement. \n'C' rating reflects very high risk of default regarding timely servicing of financial obligations as against moderate degree of safety regarding timely servicing of financial obligations for 'BBB', as per ICRA. \n1:51 pm Petronet aims to partner for Qatar project: India's Petronet LNG Ltd wants to partner with ONGC Videsh (OVL), the overseas arm of India's biggest explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd, to pick up a stake in an upcoming exploration and liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Qatar, a company official said. \nThe project would be Petronet's maiden venture into the natural gas exploration and production business and overseas LNG terminals. \n\"We will be signing a non-confidentiality agreement with QatarGas in the next one week or so, and then evaluate the project,\"Â Prabhat Singh, managing director and chief executive officer of Petronet told Reuters at the International Energy Forum on Wednesday. \n1:40 pm Earnings : Sanwaria Agro Oils has reported profit at Rs 35.7 crore for the quarter ended March 2018, which was more than doubled compared to Rs 15.3 crore in year-ago. \nOperating profit margin also doubled to 4.2 percent from 2.1 percent on year-on-year basis. The stock price rallied more than 4 percent. \n1:25 pm Fortis in focus: Manipal Hospitals Enterprises Private Ltd raised its offer to buy rival Fortis Healthcare Ltd's hospital business by about a fifth in an attempt to win over minority shareholders opposed to the deal. \nThe new offer values Fortis' hospital business about 21 percent higher at Rs 6,061 crore (USD 933.3 million), or Rs 116 per share, Manipal Hospitals said in a statement late on Tuesday. \nManipal first offered to buy Fortis last month in a deal that would combine its 14 hospitals with Fortis's portfolio of 34 hospitals, creating a 150 billion rupees company and formidable rival to Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd. \nBut the previous bid, which offered shareholders 10.83 shares in the combined company for every 100 Fortis shares held, was panned by investors. It knocked Fortis stock down 14 percent on the day the deal was announced and prompted Chief Executive Bhavdeep Singh to make conciliatory comments about keeping minority shareholders' concerns in mind. \n1:15 pm Bid for Air India : India's steel-to-autos conglomerate Tata Group, widely seen as a potential suitor for Air India, is unlikely to consider a bid for the state-run carrier as the government's terms are just too onerous, two sources familiar with the matter said. \nIndia, keen to sell the loss-making, debt-ridden airline, finalised plans in late March to divest a 76 percent stake and offload about USD 5.1 billion of its debt. \nBut the government has stipulated the winning bidder cannot merge the airline with existing businesses as long as the government holds a stake. The winner may also be required to list Air India and would need to abide by conditions designed to safeguard employee interests, restricting its ability to cut staff. \nSince the terms were disclosed, no company has come forward to say it is interested or to reaffirm previous interest, while Jet Airways and rival IndiGo, have already publicly opted out of the race, reports Reuters. \n1:01 pm Iran Oil Minister on Crude Oil Prices : Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said that USD 60 a barrel is a good price for oil currently as the market should avoid volatility. \n\"I believe in this situation around 60 (dollars per barrel) is a good price,\" said Zangeneh, who was attending the International Energy Forum. \n\"I think we should look at the market not for short-term, long-term, mid-term is important for us,\" he said. \"It is very important for producers and consumers not to have volatility in the market.\" \nWhen asked if global benchmark Brent oil trading at USD 70 a barrel were too high, Zangeneh answered, \"Yes.\" \nZangeneh added that he hopes India and Iran can finalise the main issue on the development of the Farzad B natural gas field in the next two months, reports Reuters. \nHere are the top headlines at 1 pm from Moneycontrol News' Sakshi Batra \n12:50 pm Market Update: The market continued to consolidate after showing upside in previous four consecutive sessions, as investors look for corporate earnings, macro data and crude oil prices movement. \nVedanta is the   Nifty50 stocks, rising nearly 4 percent followed by Hindalco, Reliance Industries, Infosys, TCS, Sun Pharma that gained 1-2 percent. \nOil retailers HPCL, BPCL and IOC extended fall to 8 percent after crude oil prices crossed USD 70 a barrel \n12:40 pm Vedanta's Expansion on Track: Vedanta Resources said its plans for capacity expansion at the Thootukudi copper smelting plant in Tamil Nadu were on track, a day after its application to renew operations was rejected by the state pollution regulator. \nVedanta said on Tuesday its application for renewal of consent to operate its copper smelting plant, one of India's biggest, was rejected by the state pollution control board. \nPeople in Thootukudi have been protesting against the proposed expansion of the smelter, thronging the streets and shutting shops to press their demand for closure of the plant. \nVedanta says the protests are based on \"false allegations\" and the company has been providing \"regular information through various media on the truth\". The company plans to double capacity at the smelter to 800,000 tonnes per year. \n12:30 pm Stake Buy: Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil producer, will buy 50 percent stake in the mega USD 44-billion oil refinery in Maharashtra. \nA memorandum of understanding (MoU) to this effect was signed on sidelines of the International Energy Forum (IEF) conference here. \nSaudi Oil Minister, Khalid A. Al-Falih, said India is a priority destination for Saudi investment and Aramco will continue to scout for opportunities beyond the west coast refinery. \nSaudi Arabia will supply half of the 60 million tonne capacity, he said. \nState-owned IOC, BPCL and HPCL will hold the remaining 50 percent stake in the project. \n12:20 pm Economic Growth: India's economic growth will rise to 7.3 percent this fiscal and further to 7.6 percent in the next financial year, retaining the fastest-growing Asian economy tag, on back of GST and banking reforms. \nIn its Asian Development Outlook (ADO), 2018, Manila-based ADB said, \"risks to trade are high\" and retaliatory actions could dent growth in the Asian region going forward. \nIndian economy grew 6.6 percent in the last fiscal as it battled the lingering effects of demonetisation in 2016, businesses adjusting to goods and services tax (GST) in 2017, and a subdued agriculture. The country's economic growth was 7.1 percent in 2016-17. \nWith 7.3 percent growth projected for this fiscal, India would be reversing the two-year declining trend. \n12:10 pm Buzzing: Mahanagar Gas scrip price fell 3 percent after big block deals in opening which were worth more than Rs 800 crore. \nMore than 90.5 lakh shares traded on the National Stock Exchange at an average price of Rs 911.10 per share through block deals in opening. \n11:58 am Acquisition : Narendra Investments (Delhi) informed exchange the completion of acquisition of 51 percent stake in Fudkor India (FUDKOR) and 100 percent stake in Vegico Foods (VEGICO). With this acquisition, both the companies have become 51 percent and 100 percent subsidiaries of Narendra Investments (Delhi), respectively. \n11:48 am Market Update: The market is mildly lower amid mixed Asian cues, as investors look for corporate   week, macro data due tomorrow and crude oil prices that hit four-year high. \nPSU Bank is the biggest loser among sectoral indices, falling 2 percent while IT and Metal indices gain 1 percent each \n11:38 am Deutsche Bank bets big on property developers : Property developers are among the worst-performing industry group in India’s equity market this year, but Deutsche Bank said it is time to bet on the big players. \nThere are early signs of recovery in the commercial and residential segments as the after-effects of policy measures that hurt demand are fading, Bijay Kumar, an analyst at Deutsche Equities India Pvt, wrote in an April 9 note. It advises buying Godrej Properties and Oberoi Realty, while recommending investors hold DLF. \n11:25 am MF houses keeping a close eye on banks: Fund managers at domestic mutual funds are closely watching the developments at ICICI Bank and Axis Bank, as the two major private sector lenders grapple with leadership issues. \nAs on December 31, 2017, domestic mutual funds owned 22.62 percent in ICICI Bank and 9.5 percent in Axis Bank. \nFund managers who spoke to Moneycontrol on conditions of anonymity said there was no cause for panic at the moment. They, however, would wait for clarity before investing further in both stocks. \n11:05 am Market Outlook: The expectations run high as India Inc. starts declaring numbers for the quarter ended March 31, and if earnings fails to surprise on the upside, the valuations of Indian markets will look expensive, suggest experts. \n“We expect decent earnings this quarter and for Sensex, we see a 10 percent earnings growth for the quarter ended March 31. However, there should be high-teens earnings growth, else valuations will be expensive,” Sanjeev Prasad of Kotak Institutional Equities told Moneycontrol. \nCommenting on the macros, Prasad said that India has a lot of macro variables that are to be tracked closely such as higher oil prices which could impact bond yields. \n10:49 am Order Win : Generic Engineering Construction & Projects Limited said it has been awarded orders worth Rs 101.53 crore from many reputed clients. \n10:38 am Market Update : Benchmark indices were off their day's lows after cool off in crude oil prices from four-year high. \nThe 30-share BSE Sensex was down 41.72 points at 33,838.53 and the 50-share NSE Nifty fell 25.80 points to 10,376.50. \nAbout three shares declined for every two shares rising on the BSE. \nTechnology, metals and oil exploration companies' share prices supported the market whereas oil retailers and banks were under pressure. 10:20 am Order Win : Va Tech Wabag, a leading pure play water technology Indian multinational company has been awarded an order for Rs 147 crore\nby Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd, under the Namami Gange scheme (National Mission for Clean Ganga — NMCG) towards design, build and operate 60 MLD sewage treatment plant at Patna. \nThe project will be jointly financed by World Bank and NMCG. \nWABAG has won a repeat order for Rs 83 crore towards design, build and operation of 124 MLD water treatment plant (WTP) at Rajpur-Sonarpur in Kolkata from Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority. \nThe plant will be designed using space saving plate settler technology with rapid gravity filters.

      "text": "BANGKOK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Thai energy companies are on a roll. The national oil and gas champion, a coal miner and power utility, upstart solar and wind companies, virtually all are expanding across Southeast Asia, applying practices and technology developed at home.\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows the Bangchak oil refinery in Bangkok, Thailand, October 3, 2017. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo Thailand is reaping the benefits of two decades of government energy policies that have supported the sector. Companies are also profiting from oil and gas prices that are recovering from a three-year slump, increasing electricity demand due to economic growth, and renewable technologies that have become competitive against fossil fuels.\nAlso, while the military junta that has ruled Thailand since mid-2014 has put no stamp of its own on the energy sector, it has targeted infrastructure spending to boost the economy and prioritized investment in hi-tech industries.\nLong-standing reform policies have turned Thailand’s state energy company PTT into a successful international oil and gas producer, encouraged the development of power producers such as Electricity Generating, and fostered the emergence of renewable start-ups like Energy Absolute.\n“The power businesses in Thailand have developed expertise in this sector, and are now well placed to support energy development across the region,” said Robert Grant, Asia Pacific head at Canadian-listed SNC-Lavalin, an engineering and construction firm focused on energy, infrastructure and mining.\nThe 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) together have a population of more than 600 million people, with a collective gross domestic product (GDP) of nearly $3 trillion, according to research company Statista.\nASEAN’s energy use rose by 60 percent in the last 15 years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which also says the region’s demand could grow another two-thirds by 2040.\nCompanies aiming to take part in the growth in ASEAN and beyond include B.Grimm Power, a Thai power developer that already has assets in Vietnam and Laos, and Banpu Power, which is building a coal-fired plant in China.\n“You can already see increased activity by Thai investors in the ASEAN region,” Grant said.\nThe expansion has been reflected in the local stock exchange, with shares of energy companies growing nearly 75 percent since the start of 2016, against a broader market gain of less than half that.\nIt’s also sparked a rash of listings, with Thai power companies having raised more than $2 billion from initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2016 and 2017.\nThailand’s third-biggest generator, Gulf Energy, in December held the biggest listing the country has seen in a decade, at more than $700 million.\nGulf has said it expects revenue to grow by 18 percent this year, fueled in part by a major solar investment in Vietnam. The IPO funds will be used to repay loans and finance new regional power plants, it says.\n(GRAPHIC: Thai energy company stock market performance - reut.rs/2ILuH71 )\n‘ECOSYSTEM FOR GROWTH’ Government policy “created an ecosystem for growth for Thai energy companies,” said Maria Lapiz, head of institutional research at Maybank Kim Eng Securities, with the first reforms coming in the 1990s.\nThat’s when the government began allowing small power generators (1-90 megawatts) to sell to the national grid. Thailand was also an earlier adopter of natural gas, which now generates about 60 percent of its electricity.\nIn 2012, Thailand was one of Asia’s first countries to introduce “feed-in” tariffs to give solar developers additional payments on top of normal prices when selling electricity to utilities, channeling investment into the sector.\nSimilar tariffs have been applied to other renewable power sources, including wind, small-scale hydro, biomass and biogas.\nThe privatization of PTT was another big boost to the energy sector. The government now holds a 51 percent stake in PTT, which operates as a private company with less political interference than state rivals like Malaysia’s Petronas and Indonesia’s Pertamina, both of which remain under full government control.\n“PTT was privatized in 2001, which helped drive growth in the energy sector from E&P to refiners and helped in the development of the Thai capital market,” said Lapiz.\nThe growth trend is clearest in renewables, where Thailand is the first Southeast Asia nation to crack the top 15 solar power generators, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).\n(GRAPHIC: Top 15 solar power producers by installed capacity (2016) - reut.rs/2IK1Z6a )\nGROWING ABROAD “Thailand started development in renewable power much earlier than regional peers,” said Thidasiri Srisamith, Chief Investment Officer of Kasikorn Asset Management.\nThanks to the early start and good relationships with neighboring governments, Thailand is “a leader in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam, and will continue to expand into these countries,” she said.\nThailand’s largest solar company, Superblock, plans to branch out with a $1.8 billion investment into wind farms in Vietnam.\nAnd Thailand’s biggest wind power generator, Wind Energy Holdings, plans to invest in solar, hydro and biomass to back up its capacity, not just locally but also in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Australia.\nEven in coal, a sector recently shunned due to public pressure to invest in cleaner energy, Thai firms are growing. Miner Banpu in February reported a more than 250 percent surge in annual profit, partly because of new coal mine investments, including in Indonesia, and power projects in China and Japan.\nIn oil and gas, PTT - long the global carrier of the Thai exploration and production flag - is developing new assets in the region for the first time in years, with around $4.5 billion in cash on hand to invest at home and overseas.\nNot all indicators point to an ongoing boom. Local consumption is stalling due to low population growth and improvements in energy efficiency, while domestic capacity is sufficient to meet basic requirements.\n“Going forward, Thai power company growth will depend on the ability to secure capacity and have a steady stream of projects ... which (are) increasingly coming from overseas,” said Kasikorn’s Thidasiri.\n(GRAPHIC: Thailand renewables power generation capacity - reut.rs/2qnMmdo )\nFILE PHOTO: PTT headquarters building is pictured in Bangkok, Thailand, January 5, 2016.

      "title": "Full text: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg's testifies before US Congress — here's what he said - The Indian Express",
      "text": "Mr. Zuckerberg, what is Facebook doing to prevent foreign actors from interfering in U.S. elections? \nZUCKERBERG: Thank you, Senator. \nThis is one of my top priorities in 2018 — is to get this right. I — one of my greatest regrets in running the company is that we were slow in identifying the Russian information operations in 2016. We expected them to do a number of more traditional cyber attacks, which we did identify and notify the campaigns that they were trying to hack into them. \nBut we were slow at identifying the type of — of new information operations. \nFEINSTEIN: When did you identify new operations? \nZUCKERBERG: It was right around the time of the 2016 election itself. So, since then, we — 2018 is — is an incredibly important year for elections. Not just in — with the U.S. midterms, but, around the world, there are important elections — in India, in Brazil, in Mexico, in Pakistan and in Hungary, that — we want to make sure that we do everything we can to protect the integrity of those elections. \nNow, I have more confidence that we’re going to get this right, because, since the 2016 election, there have been several important elections around the world where we’ve had a better record. There was the French presidential election. There was the German election. There was the U.S. Senate Alabama special election last year. \nFEINSTEIN: Explain what is better about the record. \nZUCKERBERG: So we’ve deployed new A.I. tools that do a better job of identifying fake accounts that may be trying to interfere in elections or spread misinformation. And, between those three elections, we were able to proactively remove tens of thousands of accounts that — before they — they could contribute significant harm. \nAnd the nature of these attacks, though, is that, you know, there are people in Russia whose job it is — is to try to exploit our systems and other internet systems, and other systems, as well. \nSo this is an arms race, right? I mean, they’re going to keep on getting better at this, and we need to invest in keeping on getting better at this, too, which is why one of things I mentioned before is we’re going to have more than 20,000 people, by the end of this year, working on security and content review across the company. \nFEINSTEIN: Speak for a moment about automated bots that spread disinformation. What are you doing to punish those who exploit your platform in that regard? \nZUCKERBERG: Well, you’re not allowed to have a fake account on Facebook. Your content has to be authentic. So we build technical tools to try to identify when people are creating fake accounts — especially large networks of fake accounts, like the Russians have — in order to remove all of that content. \nAfter the 2016 election, our top priority was protecting the integrity of other elections around the world. But, at the same time, we had a parallel effort to trace back to Russia the IRA activity — the Internet Research Agency activity that was — the part of the Russian government that — that did this activity in — in 2016. \nAnd, just last week, we were able to determine that a number of Russian media organizations that were sanctioned by the Russian regulator were operated and controlled by this Internet Research Agency. \nSo we took the step last week — that was a pretty big step for us — of taking down sanctioned news organizations in Russia as part of an operation to remove 270 fake accounts and pages, part of their broader network in Russia, that was — that was actually not targeting international interference as much as — sorry, let me correct that. \nIt was (ph) primarily targeting — spreading misinformation in Russia itself, as well as certain Russian-speaking neighboring countries. \nFEINSTEIN: How many accounts of this type have you taken down? \nZUCKERBERG: Across — in the IRA specifically, the ones that we’ve pegged back to the IRA, we can identify the 470 in the American elections in the 270 that we specifically went after in Russia last week. \nThere were many others that our systems catch, which are more difficult to attribute specifically to Russian intelligence, but the number would be in the tens of thousands of fake accounts that we remove. And I’m happy to have my team follow up with you on more information, if that would be helpful. \nFEINSTEIN: Would you, please? I think this is very important. \nIf you knew in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica was using the information of Professor Kogan’s, why didn’t Facebook ban Cambridge in 2015? Why’d you wait another (ph)… \n(CROSSTALK) \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, that’s a — a great question. \nCambridge Analytica wasn’t using our services in 2015, as far as we can tell. So this is — this is clearly one of the questions that I asked our team, as soon as I learned about this — is why — why did we wait until we found out about the reports last month to — to ban them. \nIt’s because, as of the time that we learned about their activity in 2015, they weren’t an advertiser. They weren’t running pages. So we actually had nothing to ban. \nFEINSTEIN: Thank you. \nGRASSLEY: No, thank you, Senator Feinstein. \nNow, Senator Hatch. \nSEN. ORRIN HATCH (R-UTAH): Well, in my opinion, this is the most — this is the most intense public scrutiny I’ve seen for a tech-related hearing since the Microsoft hearing that — that I chaired back in the late 1990s. \nThe recent stories about Cambridge Analytica and data mining on social media have raised serious concerns about consumer privacy, and, naturally, I know you understand that. \nAt the same time, these stories touch on the very foundation of the internet economy and the way the websites that drive our internet economy make money. Some have professed themselves shocked — shocked that companies like Facebook and Google share user data with advertisers. \nDid any of these individuals ever stop to ask themselves why Facebook and Google didn’t — don’t change — don’t charge for access? Nothing in life is free. Everything involves trade-offs. \nIf you want something without having to pay money for it, you’re going to have to pay for it in some other way, it seems to me. And that’s where — what we’re seeing here. \nAnd these great websites that don’t charge for access — they extract value in some other way. And there’s nothing wrong with that, as long as they’re up-front about what they’re doing. \nTo my mind, the issue here is transparency. It’s consumer choice. Do users understand what they’re agreeing to — to when they access a website or agree to terms of service? Are websites up-front about how they extract value from users, or do they hide the ball? \nDo consumers have the information they need to make an informed choice regarding whether or not to visit a particular website? To my — to my mind, these are questions that we should ask or be focusing on. \nNow, Mr. Zuckerberg, I remember well your first visit to Capitol Hill, back in 2010. You spoke to the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, which I chair. You said back then that Facebook would always be free. \nIs that still your objective? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes. There will always be a version of Facebook that is free. It is our mission to try to help connect everyone around the world and to bring the world closer together. \nIn order to do that, we believe that we need to offer a service that everyone can afford, and we’re committed to doing that. \nHATCH: Well, if (ph) so, how do you sustain a business model in which users don’t pay for your service? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, we run ads. \nHATCH: I see. That’s great. Whenever a controversy like this arises, there’s always the danger that Congress’s response will be to step and overregulate. Now, that’s been the experience that I’ve had, in my 42 years here. \nIn your view, what sorts of legislative changes would help to solve the problems the Cambridge Analytica story has revealed? And what sorts of legislative changes would not help to solve this issue? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think that there are a few categories of legislation that — that make sense to consider. \nAround privacy specifically, there are a few principles that I think it would be useful to — to discuss and potentially codified into law. \nOne is around having a simple and practical set of — of ways that you explain what you are doing with data. And we talked a little bit earlier around the complexity of laying out these long privacy policies. It’s hard to say that people fully understand something when it’s only written out in a long legal document. This needs — the stuff needs to be implemented in a way where people can actually understand it, where consumers can — can understand it, but that can also capture all the nuances of how these services work in a way that doesn’t — that’s not overly restrictive on –on providing the services. That’s one. \nThe second is around giving people complete control. This is the most important principle for Facebook: Every piece of content that you share on Facebook, you own and you have complete control over who sees it and — and how you share it, and you can remove it at any time. \nThat’s why every day, about 100 billion times a day, people come to one of our services and either post a photo or send a message to someone, because they know that they have that control and that who they say it’s going to go to is going to be who sees the content. \nAnd I think that that control is something that’s important that I think should apply to — to every service. \nAnd the third point is — is just around enabling innovation. Because some of the abuse cases that — that are very sensitive, like face recognition, for example — and I feel there’s a balance that’s extremely important to strike here, where you obtain special consent for sensitive features like face recognition, but don’t — but we still need to make it so that American companies can innovate in those areas, or else we’re going to fall behind Chinese competitors and others around the world who have different regimes for — for different new features like that. \nGRASSLEY: Senator Cantwell? \nSEN. MARIA CANTWELL (D-WASH): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \nWelcome Mr. Zuckerberg. \nDo you know who Palantir is? \nZUCKERBERG: I do. \nCANTWELL: Some people refer to them as a Stanford Analytica. Do you agree? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I have not heard that. \nCANTWELL: OK. \nDo you think Palantir taught Cambridge Analytica, as press reports are saying, how to do these tactics? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do not know. \nCANTWELL: Do you think that Palantir has ever scraped data from Facebook? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I’m not aware of that. \nCANTWELL: Do you think that during the 2016 campaign, as Cambridge Analytica was providing support to the Trump campaign under Project Alamo, were there any Facebook people involved in that sharing of technique and information? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, we provided support to the Trump campaign similar to what we provide to any advertiser or campaign who asks for it. \nCANTWELL: So that was a yes. Was that a yes? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, can you repeat the specific question? I just want to make sure I get specifically what you’re asking. \nCANTWELL: During the 2016 campaign, Cambridge Analytica worked with the Trump campaign to refine tactics. And were Facebook employees involved in that? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I don’t know that our employees were involved with Cambridge Analytica. Although I know that we did help out the Trump campaign overall in sales support in the same way that we do with other companies. \nCANTWELL: So they may have been involved and all working together during that time period? Maybe that’s something your investigation will find out. \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, my — I can certainly have my team get back to you on any specifics there that I don’t know, sitting here today. \nCANTWELL: Have you heard of Total Information Awareness? Do you know what I’m talking about? \nZUCKERBERG: No, I do not. \nCANTWELL: OK. Total Information Awareness was, 2003, John Ashcroft and others trying to do similar things to what I think is behind all of this — geopolitical forces trying to get data and information to influence a process. \nSo, when I look at Palantir and what they’re doing; and I look at WhatsApp, which is another acquisition; and I look at where you are, from the 2011 consent decree, and where you are today; I am thinking, “Is this guy outfoxing the foxes? Or is he going along with what is a major trend in an information age, to try to harvest information for political forces?” \nAnd so my question to you is, do you see that those applications, that those companies — Palantir and even WhatsApp — are going to fall into the same situation that you’ve just fallen into, over the last several years? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I’m not — I’m not sure, specifically. Overall, I — I do think that these issues around information access are challenging. \nTo the specifics about those apps, I’m not really that familiar with what Palantir does. WhatsApp collects very little information and, I — I think, is less likely to have the kind of issues because of the way that the service is architected. But, certainly, I think that these are broad issues across the tech industry. \nCANTWELL: Well, I guess, given the track record — where Facebook is and why you’re here today, I guess people would say that they didn’t act boldly enough. \nAnd the fact that people like John Bolton, basically, was an investor — in a New York Times article earlier — I guess it was actually last month — that the Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp-wristed and spineless, and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues. \nSo the fact that, you know, there are a lot of people who are interested in this larger effort — and what I think my constituents want to know is, was this discussed at your board meetings? And what are the applications and interests that are being discussed without putting real teeth into this? \nWe don’t want to come back to this situation again. I believe you have all the talent. My question is whether you have all the will to help us solve this problem. \nZUCKERBERG: Yes, Senator. \nSo data privacy and foreign interference in elections are certainly topics that we have discussed at the board meeting. These are some of the biggest issues that the company has faced, and we feel a huge responsibility to get these right. \nCANTWELL: Do you believe European regulations should be applied here in the U.S.? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection. And, regardless of whether we implement the exact same regulation, I would guess that it would be somewhat different, because we have somewhat different sensibilities in the U.S. as to other countries. \nWe’re committed to rolling out the controls and the affirmative consent and the special controls around sensitive types of technology, like face recognition, that are required in GDPR. We’re doing that around the world. \nSo I think it’s certainly worth discussing whether we should have something similar in the U.S. But what I would like to say today is that we’re going to go forward and implement that, regardless of what the regulatory outcome is. \nGRASSLEY: Senator Wicker? \nSenator Thune will chair next. \nSenator Wicker? \nSEN. ROGER WICKER (R-MISS): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \nAnd, Mr. Zuckerberg, thank you for being with us. \nMy question is going to be, sort of, a follow-up on what Senator Hatch was talking about. And let me agree with basically his — his advice, that we don’t want to overregulate (inaudible) to the point where we’re stifling innovation and investment. \nI understand with regard to suggested rules or suggested legislation, there are at least two schools of thought out there. \nOne would be the ISPs, the internet service providers, who are advocating for privacy protections for consumers that apply to all online entities equally across the entire internet ecosystem. \nNow, Facebook is an edge provider on the other hand. It is my understanding that many edge providers, such as Facebook, may not support that effort, because edge providers have different business models than the ISPs and should not be considered like services. \nSo, do you think we need consistent privacy protections for consumers across the entire internet ecosystem that are based on the type of consumer information being collected, used or shared, regardless of the entity doing the collecting, reusing or sharing? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, this is an important question. \nI would differentiate between ISPs, which I consider to be the pipes of the internet, and the platforms like Facebook or Google or Twitter, YouTube that are the apps or platforms on top of that. \nI think in general, the expectations that people have of the pipes are somewhat different from the platforms. So there might be areas where there needs to be more regulation in one and less in the other, but I think that there are going to be other places where there needs to be more regulation of the other type. \nSpecifically, though, on the pipes, one of the important issues that — that I think we face and have debated is… \nWICKER: When you — when you say “pipes,” you mean… \nZUCKERBERG: ISPs. \nWICKER: … the ISPs. \nZUCKERBERG: Yeah. \nSo I know net neutrality has been a — a hotly debated topic, and one of the reasons why I have been out there saying that I think that should be the case is because, you know, I look at my own story of when I was getting started building Facebook at Harvard, you know, I only had one option for an ISP to use. And if I had to pay extra in order to make it so that my app could potentially be seen or used by other people, then — then we probably wouldn’t be here today. \nWICKER: OK, well — but we’re talking about privacy concerns. And let me just say, we’ll — we’ll have to follow up on this. But I think you and I agree, this is going to be one of the major items of debate if we have to go forward and — and do this from a governmental standpoint. \nLet me just move on to another couple of items. \nIs it true that — as was recently publicized, that Facebook collects the call and text histories of its users that use Android phones? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, we have an app called Messenger for sending messages to your Facebook friends. And that app offers people an option to sync their — their text messages into the messenging app, and to make it so that — so basically so you can have one app where it has both your texts and — and your Facebook messages in one place. \nWe also allow people the option of… \nWICKER: You can opt in or out of that? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes. It is opt-in. \nWICKER: It is easy to opt out? \nZUCKERBERG: It is opt-in. You — you have to affirmatively say that you want to sync that information before we get access to it. \nWICKER: Unless you — unless you opt in, you don’t collect that call and text history? \nZUCKERBERG: That is correct. \nWICKER: And is that true for — is this practice done at all with minors, or do you make an exception there for persons aged 13 to 17? \nZUCKERBERG: I do not know. We can follow up with that (ph). \nWICKER: OK, do that — let’s do that. \nOne other thing: There have been reports that Facebook can track a user’s internet browsing activity, even after that user has logged off of the Facebook platform. Can you confirm whether or not this is true? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator — I — I want to make sure I get this accurate, so it would probably be better to have my team follow up afterwards. \nWICKER: You don’t know? \nZUCKERBERG: I know that the — people use cookies on the internet, and that you can probably correlate activity between — between sessions. \nWe do that for a number of reasons, including security, and including measuring ads to make sure that the ad experiences are the most effective, which, of course, people can opt out of. But I want to make sure that I’m precise in my answer, so let me… \nWICKER: When — well, when you get… \nZUCKERBERG: … follow up with you on that. \nWICKER: … when you get back to me, sir, would you also let us know how Facebook’s — discloses to its users that engaging in this type of tracking gives us that result? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes. \nWICKER: And thank you very much. \nGRASSLEY: Thank you, Senator Wicker. \nSenator Leahy’s up next. \nSEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT): Thank you. \nMr. Zuckerberg, I — I assume Facebook’s been served with subpoenas from the — Special Counsel Mueller’s office. Is that correct? \nZUCKERBERG:Yes. \nLEAHY: Have you or anyone at Facebook been interviewed by the Special Counsel’s Office? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes. \nLEAHY: Have you been interviewed… \nZUCKERBERG: I have not. I — I have not. \nLEAHY: Others have? \nZUCKERBERG: I — I believe so. And I want to be careful here, because that — our work with the special counsel is confidential, and I want to make sure that, in an open session, I’m not revealing something that’s confidential. \nLEAHY: I understand. I just want to make clear that you have been contacted, you have had subpoenas. \nZUCKERBERG: Actually, let me clarify that. I actually am not aware of — of a subpoena. I believe that there may be, but I know we’re working with them. \nLEAHY: Thank you. \nSix months ago, your general counsel promised us that you were taking steps to prevent Facebook preserving (ph) what I would call an unwitting co-conspirator in Russian interference. \nBut these — these unverified, divisive pages are on Facebook today. They look a lot like the anonymous groups that Russian agents used to spread propaganda during the 2016 election. \nAre you able to confirm whether they’re Russian-created groups? Yes or no? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, are you asking about those specifically? \nLEAHY: Yes. \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, last week, we actually announced a major change to our ads and pages policies: that we will be identifying the identity of every single advertiser… \nLEAHY: I’m asking about specific ones. Do you know whether they are? \nZUCKERBERG: I am not familiar with those pieces of content specifically. \nLEAHY: But, if you decided (ph) this policy a week ago, you’d be able to verify them? \nZUCKERBERG: We are working on that now. What we’re doing is we’re going to verify the identity of any advertiser who’s running a political or issue-related ad — this is basically what the Honest Ads Act is proposing, and we’re following that. \nAnd we’re also going to do that for pages. So… \nLEAHY: But you can’t answer on these? \nZUCKERBERG: I — I’m not familiar with those specific cases. \nLEAHY: Well, will you — will you find out the answer and get back to me? \nZUCKERBERG: I’ll have my team get back to you. \nI do think it’s worth adding, though, that we’re going to do the same verification of identity and location of admins who are running large pages. \nSo, that way, even if they aren’t going to be buying ads in our system, that will make it significantly harder for Russian interference efforts or other inauthentic efforts… \nLEAHY: Well, some (ph)… \nZUCKERBERG: … to try to spread misinformation through the network. \nLEAHY: … it’s a fight that’s been going on for some time, so I might say it’s about time. \nYou know, six months ago, I asked your general counsel about Facebook’s role as a breeding ground for hate speech against Rohingya refugees. Recently, U.N. investigators blamed Facebook for playing a role in inciting possible genocide in Myanmar. And there has been genocide there. \nYou say you use A.I. to find this. This is the type of content I’m referring to. It calls for the death of a Muslim journalist. Now, that threat went straight through your detection systems, it spread very quickly, and then it took attempt after attempt after attempt, and the involvement of civil society groups, to get you to remove it. \nWhy couldn’t it be removed within 24 hours? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, what’s happening in Myanmar is a terrible tragedy, and we need to do more… \n(CROSSTALK) \nLEAHY: We all agree with that. \nZUCKERBERG: OK. \nLEAHY: But U.N. investigators have blamed you — blamed Facebook for playing a role in the genocide. We all agree it’s terrible. How can you dedicate, and will you dedicate, resources to make sure such hate speech is taken down within 24 hours? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes. We’re working on this. And there are three specific things that we’re doing. \nOne is we’re hiring dozens of more Burmese-language content reviewers, because hate speech is very language-specific. It’s hard to do it without people who speak the local language, and we need to ramp up our effort there dramatically. \nSecond is we’re working with civil society in Myanmar to identify specific hate figures so we can take down their accounts, rather than specific pieces of content. \nAnd third is we’re standing up a product team to do specific product changes in Myanmar and other countries that may have similar issues in the future to prevent this from happening. \nLEAHY: Senator Cruz and I sent a letter to Apple, asking what they’re going to do about Chinese censorship. My question, I’ll place (ph)… \nTHUNE: That’d be great. Thank you, Senator Leahy. \nLEAHY: … I’ll place for the record — I want to know what you will do about Chinese censorship, when they come to you. \nTHUNE: Senator Graham’s up next. \nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-S.C.): Thank you. \nAre you familiar with Andrew Bosworth? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes, Senator, I am. \nGRAHAM: He said, “So we connect more people. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people, more often, is de facto good.” Do you agree with that? \nZUCKERBERG: No, Senator, I do not. And, as context, Boz wrote that — Boz is what we call him internally — he wrote that as an internal note. We have a lot of discussion internally. I disagreed with it at the time that he wrote it. If you looked at the comments on the internal discussion… \nGRAHAM: Would you say… \nZUCKERBERG: … the vast majority of people internally did, too. \nGRAHAM: … that you did a poor job, as a CEO, communicating your displeasure with such thoughts? Because, if he had understood where you — where you were at, he would have never said it to begin with. \nZUCKERBERG: Well, Senator, we try to run our company in a way where people can express different opinions internally. \nGRAHAM: Well, this is an opinion that really disturbs me. And, if somebody worked for me that said this, I’d fire them. \nWho’s your biggest competitor? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, we have a lot of competitors. \nGRAHAM: Who’s your biggest? \nZUCKERBERG: I think the categories of — did you want just one? I’m not sure I can give one, but can I give a bunch? \nGRAHAM: Yes. \nZUCKERBERG: So there are three categories that I would focus on. One are the other tech platforms — so Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft — we overlap with them in different ways. \nGRAHAM: Do they do — do they provide the same service you provide? \nZUCKERBERG: In different ways — different parts of it, yes. \nGRAHAM: Let me put it this way. If I buy a Ford, and it doesn’t work well, and I don’t like it, I can buy a Chevy. If I’m upset with Facebook, what’s the equivalent product that I can go sign up for? \nZUCKERBERG: Well, there — the second category that I was going to talk about are… \n(CROSSTALK) \nGRAHAM: I’m not talking about categories. I’m talking about, is there real competition you face? Because car companies face a lot of competition. If they make a defective car, it gets out in the world, people stop buying that car; they buy another one. \nIs there (ph) an alternative to Facebook in the private sector? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes, Senator. The average American uses eight different apps to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people… \n(CROSSTALK) \nZUCKERBERG: … ranging from texting apps, to e-mail, to… \nGRAHAM: … is the same service you provide? \nZUCKERBERG: Well, we provide a number of different services. \nGRAHAM: Is Twitter the same as what you do? \nZUCKERBERG: It overlaps with a portion of what we do. \nGRAHAM: You don’t think you have a monopoly? \nZUCKERBERG: It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me. \nGRAHAM: OK. \n(LAUGHTER) \nSo it doesn’t. So, Instagram — you bought Instagram. Why did you buy Instagram? \nZUCKERBERG: Because they were very talented app developers who were making good use of our platform and understood our values. \nGRAHAM: It is a good business decision. My point is that one way to regulate a company is through competition, through government regulation. Here’s the question that all of us got to (ph) answer: What do we tell our constituents, given what’s happened here, why we should let you self-regulate? \nWhat would you tell people in South Carolina, that given all of the things we’ve just discovered here, it’s a good idea for us to rely upon you to regulate your own business practices? \nZUCKERBERG: Well, Senator, my position is not that there should be no regulation. \nGRAHAM: OK. \nZUCKERBERG: I think the internet is increasingly… \n(CROSSTALK) \nGRAHAM: You embrace regulation? \nZUCKERBERG: I think the real question, as the internet becomes more important in people’s lives, is what is the right regulation, not whether there should be or not. \nGRAHAM: But — but you, as a company, welcome regulation? \nZUCKERBERG: I think, if it’s the right regulation, then yes. \nGRAHAM: You think the Europeans had it right? \nZUCKERBERG: I think that they get things right. \nGRAHAM: Have you ever submitted… \n(LAUGHTER) \nThat’s true. So would you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry? \nZUCKERBERG: Absolutely. \nGRAHAM: OK. Would you submit to us some proposed regulations? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes. And I’ll have my team follow up with you so, that way, we can have this discussion across the different categories where I think that this discussion needs to happen. \nGRAHAM: Look forward to it. \nWhen you sign up for Facebook, you sign up for a terms of service. Are you familiar with that? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes. \nGRAHAM: OK. It says, “The terms govern your use of Facebook and the products, features, apps, services, technologies, software we offer — Facebook’s products or products — except where we expressly state that separate terms, and not these, apply.” \nI’m a lawyer. I have no idea what that means. But, when you look at terms of service, this is what you get. Do you think the average consumer understands what they’re signing up for? \nZUCKERBERG: I don’t think that the average person likely reads that whole document. \nGRAHAM: Yeah. \nZUCKERBERG: But I think that there are different ways that we can communicate that, and have a responsibility to do so. \nGRAHAM: Do you — do you agree with me that you better come up with different ways, because this ain’t working? \nZUCKERBERG: Well, Senator, I think, in certain areas, that is true. And I think, in other areas, like the core part of what we do — right, if you — if you think about — just, at the most basic level, people come to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, about a hundred billion times a day to share a piece of content or a message with a specific set of people. \nAnd I think that that basic functionality people understand, because we have the controls in line every time, and given the volume of — of — of the activity, and the value that people tell us that they’re getting from that, I think that that control in line does seem to be working fairly well. \nNow we can always do better, and there are other — the services are complex, and there is more to it than just — you know, you go and you post a photo, so I — I — I agree that — that in many places we could do better. \nBut I think for the quarter of the service, it actually is quite clear. \nGRASSLEY: Thank you, Senator Graham. \nSenator Klobuchar. \nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MINN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Zuckerberg, I think we all agree that what happened here was bad. You acknowledged it was a breach of trust. And the way I explain it to my constituents is that if someone breaks into my apartment with the crowbar and they take my stuff, it’s just like if the manager gave them the keys or if they didn’t have any locks on the doors, it’s still a breach; it’s still a break in. And I believe we need to have laws and rules that are sophisticated as the — the brilliant products that you’ve developed here. And we just haven’t done that yet. \nAnd one of the areas that I’ve focused on is the election. And I appreciate the support that you and Facebook, and now Twitter, actually, have given to the Honest Ads Act bill that you mentioned, that I’m leading with Senator McCain and Senator Warner. \nAnd I just want to be clear, as we work to pass this law so that we have the same rules in place to disclose political ads and issue ads as we do for TV and radio, as well as disclaimers, that you’re going to take early action, as soon as June I heard, before this election so that people can view these ads, including issue ads. Is that correct? \nZUCKERBERG: That is correct, senator. And I just want to take a moment before I go into this in more detail to thank you for your leadership on this. This, I think, is an important area for the whole industry to move on. \nThe two specific things that we’re doing are — one is around transparency, so now you’re going to be able to go and click on any advertiser or any page on Facebook and see all of the ads that they’re running. So that actually brings advertising online — on Facebook to an even higher standard than what you would have on TV or print media, because there’s nowhere where you can see all of the TV ads that someone is running, for example. Whereas you will be able to see now on Facebook whether this campaign or third party is saying different messages to different types of people, and I think that that’s a really important element of transparency. \nBut the other really important piece is around verifying every single advertiser who’s going to be running political or issue ads. \nKLOBUCHAR: I appreciate that. And Senator Warner and I have also called on Google and the other platforms to do the same. So memo to the rest of you, we have to get this done or we’re going to have a patchwork of ads, and I hope that you’ll be working with us to pass this bill. Is that right? \nZUCKERBERG: We will. \nKLOBUCHAR: OK, thank you. \nNow on the subject of Cambridge Analytica, were these people, the 87 million people, users, concentrated in certain states? Are you able to figure out where they’re from? \nZUCKERBERG: I do not have that information with me, but we can follow up with your — your office. \nKLOBUCHAR: OK, because as we know, that election was close, and it was only thousands of votes in certain states. You’ve also estimated that roughly 126 people — million people may have been shown content from a Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency. \nHave you determined when — whether any of those people were the same Facebook users who’s data was shared with Cambridge Analytica? Are you able to make that determination? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, we’re investigating that now. We believe that it is entirely possible that there will be a connection there. \nKLOBUCHAR: OK, that seems like a big deal as we look back at that last election. Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wiley has said that the data that it improperly obtained — that Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained from Facebook users could be stored in Russia. \nDo you agree that that’s a possibility? \nZUCKERBERG: Sorry, are you — are you asking if Cambridge Analytica’s data — data could be stored in Russia? \nKLOBUCHAR: That’s what he said this weekend on a Sunday show. \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I don’t have any specific knowledge that would suggest that. \nBut one of the steps that we need to take now is go do a full audit of all of Cambridge Analytica’s systems to understand what they’re doing, whether they still have any data, to make sure that they remove all the data. If they don’t, we’re going to take legal action against them to do so. \nThat audit, we have temporarily ceded (ph) that in order to let the U.K. government complete their government investigation first, because, of course, a government investigation takes precedence against a company doing that. But we are committed to completing this full audit and getting to the bottom of what’s going on here, so that way we can have more answers to this. \nKLOBUCHAR: OK. \nYou earlier stated publicly and here that you would support some privacy rules so that everyone’s playing by the same rules here. And you also said here that you should have notified customers earlier. \nWould you support a rule that would require you to notify your users of a breach within 72 hours? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, that makes sense to me. And I think we should have our team follow up with — with yours to — to discuss the details around that more. \nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you. \nI just think part of this was when people don’t even know that their data’s been breached, that’s a huge problem. And I also think we get to solutions faster when we get that information out there. \nThank you. And we look forward to passing this bill — we’d love to pass it before the election — on the honest ads. And I’m looking forward to better disclosure this election. \nThank you. \nTHUNE: Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. \nSenator Blunt’s up next. \nSEN. ROY BLUNT (R-MO): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. \nMr. Zuckerberg, nice to see you. \nWhen I saw you not too long after I entered the Senate in 2011, I told you, when I sent my business cards down to be printed, they came back from the Senate print shop with the message that it was the first business card they’d ever printed a Facebook address on. \nThere are days when I’ve regretted that, but more days when we get lots of information that we need to get. There are days when I wonder if “Facebook friends” is a little misstated. It doesn’t seem like I have those every single day. \nBut, you know, the — the platform you’ve created is really important. And my son Charlie, who’s 13, is dedicated to Instagram. So he’d want to be sure I mentioned him while I was here with — with you. \nI haven’t printed that on my card yet, I — I will — will say that, but I think we have that account as well. Lots of ways to connect people. \nAnd the — the information, obviously, is an important commodity and it’s what makes your business work. I get that. \nHowever, I wonder about some of the collection efforts. And maybe we can go through largely just even “yes” and “no” and then we’ll get back to more expansive discussion of this. \nBut do you collect user data through cross-device tracking? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I believe we do link people’s accounts between devices in order to make sure that their Facebook and Instagram and their other experiences can be synched between their devices. \nBLUNT: And that would also include offline data, data that’s tracking that’s not necessarily linked to Facebook, but linked to one — some device they went through Facebook on, is that right? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I want to make sure we get this right. So I want to have my team follow up with you on that afterwards. \nBLUNT: Well, now, that doesn’t seem that complicated to me. Now, you — you understand this better than I do, but maybe — maybe you can explain to me why that’s that — why that’s complicated. \nDo you track devices that an individual who uses Facebook has that is connected to the device that they use for their Facebook connection, but not necessarily connected to Facebook? \nZUCKERBERG: I’m not — I’m not sure of the answer to that question. \nBLUNT: Really? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes. There — there may be some data that is necessary to provide the service that we do. But I don’t — I don’t have that on — sitting here today. So that’s something that I would want to follow up on. \nBLUNT: Now, the FTC, last year, flagged cross-device tracking as one of their concerns — generally, that people are tracking devices that the users of something like Facebook don’t know they’re being tracked. \nHow do you disclose your collected — collection methods? Is that all in this document that I would see and agree to before I entered into Facebook? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes, Senator. So there are — there are two ways that we do this. One is we try to be exhaustive in the legal documents, or on the terms of service and privacy policies. But, more importantly, we try to provide in-line controls so that — that are in plain English, that people can understand. \nThey can either go to settings, or we can show them at the top of the app, periodically, so that people understand all the controls and settings they have and can — can configure their experience the way that they want. \nBLUNT: So do people — do people now give you permission to track specific devices in their contract? And, if they do, is that a relatively new addition to what you do? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I’m sorry. I don’t have that. \nBLUNT: Am I able to — am I able to opt out? Am I able to say, “It’s OK for you to track what I’m saying on Facebook, but I don’t want you to track what I’m texting to somebody else, off Facebook, on an Android phone (ph)”? \nZUCKERBERG: OK. Yes, Senator. In — in general, Facebook is not collecting data from other apps that you use. There may be some specific things about the device that you’re using that Facebook needs to understand in order to offer the service. \nBut, if you’re using Google or you’re using some texting app, unless you specifically opt in that you want to share the texting app information, Facebook wouldn’t see that. \nBLUNT: Has it always been that way? Or is that a recent addition to how you deal with those other ways that I might communicate? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, my understanding is that that is how the mobile operating systems are architected. \nBLUNT: The — so do you — you don’t have bundled permissions for how I can agree to what devices I may use, that you may have contact with? Do you — do you bundle that permission? Or am I able to, one at a — individually say what I’m willing for you to — to watch, and what I don’t want you to watch? \nAnd I think we might have to take that for the record, based on everybody else’s time. \nTHUNE: Thank you, Senator Blunt. \nNext up, Senator Durbin. \nSEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-ILL): Thanks very much, Mr. Chairman. \nMr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night? \nZUCKERBERG: No. \n(LAUGHTER) \nDURBIN: If you messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people you’ve messaged? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, no. I would probably not choose to do that publicly, here. \nDURBIN: I think that may be what this is all about: your right to privacy, the limits of your right to privacy and how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, “connecting people around the world;” a question, basically, of what information Facebook’s collecting, who they’re sending it to and whether they ever asked me, in advance, my permission to do that. Is that a fair thing for the user of Facebook to expect? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes, Senator. I think everyone should have control over how their information is used. And as we’ve talked about in some of the other questions, I think of that is laid out in and some of the documents, but more importantly, you want your people control in the product itself. \nSo the most important way that this happens across our services is that every day, people come to our services to choose to share photos or send messages, and every single time they choose to share something, there — they have a control right there about who they want to share it with. But that level of control is extremely important. \nDURBIN: They certainly know within the Facebook pages who their friends are, but they may not know as has happened — and you’ve conceded this point in the past, that sometimes that information is going way beyond there friends, and sometimes people have made money off of sharing that information, correct? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, you are referring I think to our developer platform, and it may be useful for me to give some background on how we set that up, if that’s useful. \nDURBIN: I have three minutes left, so maybe you can do that for the record, because I have couple other questions I would like to ask. You have recently announced something that is called Messenger Kids. Facebook created an app allowing kids between the ages of 6 and 12 to send video and text messages through Facebook as an extension of their parent’s account. You have cartoonlike stickers, and other features designed to appeal to little kids — first-graders, kindergarteners. \nOn January 30th, the Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood and lots of other child development organizations warned Facebook. They pointed to a wealth of research demonstrating the excessive use of digital devices and social media is harmful to kids, and argued that young children simply are not ready to handle social media accounts at age 6. In addition, their concerns about data that is being gathered about these kids. \nNow, there are certain limits of the law, we know. There’s a Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. What guarantees can you give us the note data from Messenger Kids is or will be collected or shared with those of might violate that law? \nZUCKERBERG: All right, senator, so a number of things I think are — are important here. The background on Messenger Kids is, we heard feedback from thousands of parents that they want to be able to stay in touch with their kids and call them, use apps like FaceTime when they’re working late or not around and want to communicate with their kids, but they want to have complete control over that. So I think we can all agree that if you — when your kid is 6 or 7, even if they have access to a phone, you want to control everyone who they can contact. And there was an app out there that did that. So we build this service to do that. \nThe app collects a minimum amount of information that is necessary to operate the service. So, for example, the messages that people send is something that we collect in order to operate the service, but in general, that data is not going to be shared with third parties, it is not connected to the broader Facebook… \nDURBIN: Excuse me, as a lawyer, I picked up on that word “in general,” the phrase “in general.” It seems to suggest that in some circumstances it will be shared with third parties. \nZUCKERBERG: No. It will not. \nDURBIN: All right. Would you be open to the idea that someone having reached adult age, having grown up with Messenger Kids, should be allowed to delete the data that you collected? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes. As a matter of fact, when you become 13, which is our legal limit — our limit — we don’t allow people under the age of 13 to use Facebook — you don’t automatically go from having a Messenger Kids account to a Facebook account. You have to start over and get a Facebook account. \nSo I think it’s a good idea to consider making sure that all that information is deleted, and in general, people are going to be starting over when get their — their Facebook or other accounts. \nDURBIN: I’ll close, because I just have a few seconds. Illinois has a Biometric Information Privacy Act, or the state does, which is to regulate the commercial use of facial, voice, finger and iris scans and the like. We’re now in a fulsome debate on that. And I’m afraid Facebook has come down to the position of trying to carve out exceptions to that. I hope you’ll fill me in on how that is consistent with protecting privacy. Thank you. \nTHUNE: Thank you, Senator Durbin. \nSenator Cornyn? \nSEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TEX): Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here. I know in — up until 2014, a mantra or motto of Facebook was move fast and break things. Is that correct? \nZUCKERBERG: I don’t know when we changed it, but the mantra is currently move fast with stable infrastructure, which is a much less sexy mantra. \nCORNYN: Sounds much more boring. But my question is, during the time that it was Facebook’s mantra or motto to move fast and break things, do you think some of the misjudgments, perhaps mistakes that you’ve admitted to here, were as a result of that culture or that attitude, particularly as it regards to personal privacy of the information of your subscribers? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do think that we made mistakes because of that. But the broadest mistakes that we made here are not taking a broad enough view of our responsibility. And while that wasn’t a matter — the “move fast” cultural value is more tactical around whether engineers can ship things and — and different ways that we operate. \nBut I think the big mistake that we’ve made looking back on this is viewing our responsibility as just building tools, rather than viewing our whole responsibility as making sure that those tools are used for good. \nCORNYN: Well I — and I appreciate that. Because previously, or earlier in the past, we’ve been told that platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, the like are neutral platforms, and the people who own and run those for profit — and I’m not criticizing doing something for profit in this country. \nBut they bore no responsibility for the content. Do you agree now that Facebook and the other social media platforms are not neutral platforms, but bear some responsibility for the content? \nZUCKERBERG: I agree that we’re responsible for the content, but I think that there’s — one of the big societal questions that I think we’re going to need to answer is the current framework that we have is based on this reactive model, that assumed that there weren’t A.I. tools that could proactively tell, you know, whether something was terrorist content or something bad, so it naturally relied on requiring people to flag for a company, and then the company needing to take reasonable action. \nIn the future, we’re going to have tools that are going to be able to identify more types of bad content. And I think that there is — there are moral and legal obligation questions that I think we’ll have to wrestle with as a society about when we want to require companies to take action proactively on certain of those things, and when that gets in the way of … \nCORNYN: I appreciate that, I have two minutes left … \nZUCKERBERG: All right. \nCORNYN: … to ask you questions. \nSo you — you — interestingly, the terms of the — what do you call it, the terms of service is a legal document which discloses to your subscribers how their information is going to be used, how Facebook is going to operate. \nCORNYN: And — but you concede that — you doubt everybody reads or understands that legalese, those terms of service. So are — is that to suggest that the consent that people give subject to that terms of service is not informed consent? In other words, they may not read it, and even if they read it, they may not understand it? \nZUCKERBERG: I just think we have a broader responsibility than what the law requires. So I — what you (ph)… \nCORNYN: No, I’m talking — I’m talking about — I appreciate that. What I’m asking about, in terms of what your subscribers understand, in terms of how their data is going to be used — but let me go to the terms of service. \nUnder paragraph number two, you say, “You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook.” That’s what you’ve told us here today, a number of times. \nSo, if I chose to terminate my Facebook account, can I bar Facebook or any third parties from using the data that I had previously supplied, for any purpose whatsoever? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes, Senator. If you delete your account, we should get rid of all of your information. \nCORNYN: You should? Or do you? \nZUCKERBERG: We do. We do. \nCORNYN: How about third parties that you have contracted with to use some of that underlying information, perhaps to target advertising for themselves? You can’t — do you — do you call back that information, as well? Or does that remain in their custody? \nZUCKERBERG: Well, Senator, this is actually a very important question, and I’m glad you brought this up, because there’s a very common misperception about Facebook — that we sell data to advertisers. And we do not sell data to advertisers. We don’t sell data to anyone (ph). \nCORNYN: Well, you clearly rent it. \nZUCKERBERG: What we allow is for advertisers to tell us who they want to reach, and then we do the placement. So, if an advertiser comes to us and says, “All right, I am a ski shop and I want to sell skis to women,” then we might have some sense, because people shared skiing-related content, or said they were interested in that, they shared whether they’re a woman, and then we can show the ads to the right people without that data ever changing hands and going to the advertiser. \nThat’s a very fundamental part of how our model works and something that is often misunderstood. So I’m — I appreciate that you brought that up. \nTHUNE: Thank you, Senator Cornyn. \nWe had indicated earlier on that we would take a couple of breaks, give our witness an opportunity. And I think we’ve been going, now, for just under two hours. So I think what we’ll do is… \n(CROSSTALK) \nZUCKERBERG: You can do a few more. \n(LAUGHTER) \nTHUNE: You — you’re — you want to keep going? \nZUCKERBERG: Maybe — maybe 15 minutes. Does that work? \nTHUNE: OK. All right, we’ll keep going. \nSenator Blumenthal is up next. And we will commence. \nSEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CONN): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here today, Mr. Zuckerberg. \nYou have told us today — and you’ve told the world — that Facebook was deceived by Aleksandr Kogan when he sold user information to Cambridge Analytica, correct? \nZUCKERBERG: Yes. \nBLUMENTHAL: I want to show you the terms of service that Aleksandr Kogan provided to Facebook and note for you that, in fact, Facebook was on notice that he could sell that user information. \nHave you seen these terms of service before? \nZUCKERBERG: I have not. \nBLUMENTHAL: Who in Facebook was responsible for seeing those terms of service that put you on notice that that information could be sold? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, our app review team would be responsible for that. Had… \nBLUMENTHAL: Has anyone been fired on that app review team? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, not because of this. \nBLUMENTHAL: Doesn’t that term of service conflict with the FTC order that Facebook was under at that very time that this term of service was, in fact, provided to Facebook. And you’ll note that the Face — the FTC order specifically requires Facebook to protect privacy. Isn’t there a conflict there? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, it certainly appears that we should have been aware that this app developer submitted a term that was in conflict with the rules of the platform. \nBLUMENTHAL: Well, what happened here was, in effect, willful blindness. It was heedless and reckless, which, in fact, amounted to a violation of the FTC consent decree. Would you agree? \nZUCKERBERG: No, Senator. My understanding is that — is not that this was a violation of the consent decree. \nBut as I’ve said a number of times today, I think we need to take a broader view of our responsibility around privacy than just what is mandated in the current law. \nBLUMENTHAL: Well, here is my reservation, Mr. Zuckerberg. And I apologize for interrupting you, but my time is limited. \nWe’ve seen the apology tours before. You have refused to acknowledge even an ethical obligation to have reported this violation of the FTC consent decree. And we have letters — we’ve had contacts with Facebook employees. And I am going to submit a letter for the record from Sandy Parakilas, with your permission, that indicates not only a lack of resources, but lack of attention to privacy. \nAnd so, my reservation about your testimony today is that I don’t see how you can change your business model unless there are specific rules of the road. \nYour business model is to monetize user information to maximize profit over privacy. And unless there are specific rules and requirements enforced by an outside agency, I have no assurance that these kinds of vague commitments are going to produce action. \nSo I want to ask you a couple of very specific questions. And they are based on legislation that I’ve offered, the MY DATA Act; legislation that Senator Markey is introducing today, the CONSENT Act, which I’m joining. \nDon’t you agree that companies ought to be required to provide users with clear, plain information about how their data will be used, and specific ability to consent to the use of that information? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do generally agree with what you’re saying. And I laid that out earlier when I talked about what… \nBLUMENTHAL: Would you agree to an opt-in as opposed to an opt-out? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I think that — that certainly makes sense to discuss. And I think the details around this matter a lot. \nBLUMENTHAL: Would you (ph) agree that users should be able to access all of their information? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, yes. Of course. \nBLUMENTHAL: All of the information that you collect as a result of purchases from data brokers, as well as tracking them? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, we have already a “download your information” tool that allows people to see and to take out all of the information that Facebook — that they’ve put into Facebook or that Facebook knows about them. So, yes, I agree with that. We already have that. \nBLUMENTHAL: I have a number of other specific requests that you agree to support as part of legislation. I think legislation is necessary. The rules of the road have to be the result of congressional action. \nWe have — Facebook has participated recently in the fight against scourge — the scourge of sex trafficking. And a bill that we’ve just passed — it will be signed into law tomorrow — SESTA, the Stop Exploiting Sex Trafficking Act — was the result of our cooperation. I hope that we can cooperate on this kind of measure as well. \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I look forward to having my team work with you on this. \nTHUNE: Thank you, Senator Blumenthal. \nSenator Cruz. \nSEN. TED CRUZ (R-TEX): Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Zuckerberg, welcome. Thank you for being here. \nMr. Zuckerberg, does Facebook consider itself a neutral public forum? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, we consider ourselves to be a platform for all ideas. \nCRUZ: Let me ask the question again. Does Facebook consider itself to be a neutral public forum, and representatives of your company are giving conflicting answers on this? Are you a … \nZUCKERBERG: Well… \nCRUZ: … First Amendment speaker expressing your views, or are you a neutral public forum allowing everyone to speak? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, here’s how we think about this: I don’t believe that — there are certain content that clearly we do not allow, right? Hate speech, terrorist content, nudity, anything that makes people feel unsafe in the community. From that perspective, that’s why we generally try to refer to what we do as platform for all ideas… \nCRUZ: Let me try this, because the time is constrained. It’s just a simple question. The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you’re a neutral public forum. Do you consider yourself a neutral public forum, or are you engaged in political speech, which is your right under the First Amendment. \nZUCKERBERG: Well, senator, our goal is certainly not to engage in political speech. I am not that familiar with the specific legal language of the — the law that you — that you speak to. So I would need to follow up with you on that. I’m just trying to lay out how broadly I think about this. \nCRUZ: Mr. Zuckerberg, I will say there are a great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that that Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive pattern of bias and political censorship. There have been numerous instances with Facebook in May of 2016, Gizmodo reported that Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from trending news, including stories about CPAC, including stories about Mitt Romney, including stories about the Lois Lerner IRS scandal, including stories about Glenn Beck. \nIn addition to that, Facebook has initially shut down the Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day page, has blocked a post of a Fox News reporter, has blocked over two dozen Catholic pages, and most recently blocked Trump supporters Diamond and Silk’s page, with 1.2 million Facebook followers, after determining their content and brand were, quote, “unsafe to the community.” \nTo a great many Americans that appears to be a pervasive pattern of political bias. Do you agree with that assessment? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, let me say a few things about this. First, I understand where that concern is coming from, because Facebook in the tech industry are located in Silicon Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place, and I — this is actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in the company, is making sure that we do not have any bias in the work that we do, and I think it is a fair concern that people would at least wonder about. Now… \nCRUZ: Let me — let me ask this question: Are you aware of any ad or page that has been taken down from Planned Parenthood? \nZUCKERBERG: Senator, I’m not. But let me just… \nCRUZ: How about moveon.org?",

      "text": "Trump Praises Xi’s “Kind Words” In Fresh Sign Of Trade Detente April 11, 2018 4 \nDonald Trump, in a tweet, thanked Chinese premier Xi Jinping for his \"kind words\" (File Photo) \nWashington: President Donald Trump on Tuesday praised the \"kind words\" from Chinese leader Xi Jinping and pledged \"great progress\" in the looming trade dispute between the world's largest economies.Still, the White House also admonished China to take concrete action on US complaints about unfair trade practices.Xi earlier Tuesday pledged to open Chinese markets and lower tariffs, remarks that helped global investors breathe a sigh of relief after weeks in which Beijing and Washington appeared on a collision course.\"Very thankful for President Xi of China's kind words on tarrifs [sic] and automobile barriers… also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers,\" Trump said on Twitter.\"We will make great progress together!\" Trump predicted, hailing the speech in which Xi renewed a commitment to lower car import tariffs.But following Trump's tweet the White House made clear it wants to see changes enacted in China.\"We're encouraged by the words but we want to see concrete steps and concrete action,\" Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.\"We want to see more than just the rhetoric,\" she added, and until that happens the planned tariffs will enter into force.The fresh sign of detente could further soothe fears that the tit-for-tat exchange of threats of new punitive tariffs on agricultural and manufactured goods could boil over into an all-out trade war, damaging the global economy.Trump has signed off on duties on $50 billion of Chinese imports which are due to take effect later this year, and he threatened to retaliate with tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese goods, after Beijing said it would target US agricultural goods among other items.US officials have long accused China of forcing US companies to hand over technology, or stealing it outright, and of spurring massive industrial overcapacity, among other complaints.Xi 'Underdelivers'White House officials in recent days offered mixed messages, suggesting in some cases the tariff threats were mostly a negotiating tactic, while demanding China reduce its trade surplus with the US.In his address, Xi told an economic forum on the southern island of Hainan that China \"does not seek a trade surplus.\"Promising a \"new phase of opening up,\" Xi said China would \"considerably lower\" tariffs on cars and other products this year, take measures to liberalize automobile investment, and protect intellectual property — all areas that have been high on the list of demands by Washington.\"Economic globalization is an irreversible trend of the time,\" Xi told the Boao Forum for Asia. \"The door of China's opening up will not close, it will only open wider and wider.\"But analysts and veteran China watchers were less upbeat about Xi's remarks than Trump, pointing out that there was nothing new in the statement and the Chinese leader had previously promised reforms of the auto sector.Evan Medeiros, former US National Security Council director for Asia, noted it was \"not a new commitment and will not dramatically change the fortunes of US car companies.\"\"Xi's bland and generic commitments on IP protection fell short of what would have been a true gamechanger.\"The Eurasia Group agreed the speech was \"not a game-changer\" and said it \"underdelivers after all the hype from Beijing.\"\"Xi proposed actions which were previously promised and none address the reciprocity issues in US-China relations,\" Eurasia Group said in a briefing note.But with Trump and his supporters happy to claim a victory for a browbeating strategy, the flurry of pronouncements could open the door to talks.CommentsEarlier this week Larry Kudlow, Trump's top economic advisor, said limited interactions already had taken place but no serious discussions to avoid tariffs.(Except  ",

      "text": "After three years of flat prices, travellers' payments for overnight accommodation rose 2% globally in 2017, according to the latest Hotel Price Index from booking website Hotels.com , but Indian travellers paid less for room nights in six of the top 10 outbound destinations like the US, UK, Malaysia, Germany, Indonesia and Italy. \n\nHotels.com said this could have been caused by the strong performance of the rupee in 2017, which rose 5.5% against the US dollar in 2017. \n\nHotels .com said in a year where cryptocurrencies flooded the market, the needle also moved for travellers, with a two-point rise in the global Index to 116, the closest it has been to the 2007 peak of 118. Every regional Index, except for North America, grew in 2017, signalling growth in the travel industry. \n\nDue to the implementation of new economic policies and GST in 2017, which introduced multiple tax slabs to cover different hotel categories, Indian hotel prices witnessed an increase for the year. \n\nIndians continued to spend the most on accommodation in the UK but travellers paid 6% less per room per night in the UK vis-à-vis 2016. Domestic and inbound travellers paid the most per night in Mumbai in India.Dubai, Bangkok and Singapore emerged as the top outbound cities for Indian travellers whileNew Delhi and Mumbai continued to rule the roost among domestic and inbound visitor segments \n\nThe HPI data also showed the evolving trend towards experiential travel and exploring new cities among Indian travellers, with a growing preference for destinations such as Edinburgh (UK) and Zurich (Switzerland) that made it to the top 50 most popular outbound destinations list. \n\nThe top 10 popular outbound cities for Indian travellers list was dominated by Asia-Pacific cities (Bangkok, Singapore, Pattaya, Bali, Kuala Lampur and Hong Kong). The bucket saw little change since 2016, except Kuala Lumpur which made its way to the top 10. \n ",

      "text": "The rising tendency of protectionism across the world, especially involving the G20 countries (together account for ~84 per cent of world GDP and 79 per cent of world trade) is incongruous in the backdrop of the recent cyclical recovery in the global economy and trade, led especially by major economies like the US and Europe. \n\nConcerns about global trade hostilities getting prolonged have escalated lately in the context of the recent measures taken by the US. The Donald Trump administration has imposed tariff hikes on Steel and aluminium, triggering retaliatory actions by China , besides also kicking off renegotiations over NAFTA. \n\nBacktracking from trade liberalisation in not new. While the US is leading on trade protectionist actions, there is abundant evidence that it is pervasive across many countries. Global Trade Alert (GTA) data reveals a significant reversal in trade liberalisation since the global financial crisis 2008, and especially since 2011. \nSince 2008 countries topping the list of trade protectionism are the US (initiating over 1200 measures), India (~730), Russia (~610) and Argentina (~480). Also, the UK and Germany figure in top seven. G7 + Australia have contributed ~50 per cent to the global trade protectionist measures undertaken by G20 economies. \n\nThe number of anti-dumping initiations rose to a high of 360 in 2017, nearly double the count seen in 2011. The number of regional trade agreements, which saw a continuous rise post the Asian financial crisis in 1997-89 to a peak of 34 in 2008, declined sharply to a modest 8-9 in 2017. \n\nImportantly, the major chunk of protectionist measures comprises not tariff measures. Over 60 per cent of the G20 restrictive measures are in the form of export measures, mostly tax-based, followed by trade finance, import tariffs, subsidies (17 per cent, including export subsidies) etc. \n\nIndications are that the US administration could get even more aggressive in 2018, initiating tariff measures to provide a beneficial backdrop for the US companies in both, domestic and global markets. The US slogan of “free but fair” trade resonates with its protectionist stance of the 1980s. \n\nDissection of recent trade protectionist measures in terms of sectors reveals that most of them are aimed at metals (especially products of iron & steel). Also, China is bearing the brunt of such actions, with the US implementing most of these measures. However, with the high frequency of G20 countries taking harmful trade actions impacting fellow members is sufficient evidence to suggest dissipating commitment to shun protectionism. \n\nThere has been increasing pressure on India also to cut tariffs and dilute export incentives. Notwithstanding the reduction in average import tariffs for the most favoured nation (MFN) category to 8 per cent, there has been a steady increase from the 20-year low of 6.8 per cent in 2010 and it ranks very high against the developed countries; the US is at 1.8 per cent effective rate and an average rate of 3.2 per cent. \n\nThe big picture is that rising protectionism could be a prolonged battle. The structural catalyst behind the growing support to protectionism is the attempt by developed economies, let by the US, to reverse the shift of economic power from the advanced nations to the developing economies, especially emerging Asia. \n\nThe short-term manifestation can be seen in the rising skepticism about the benefits of trade, especially in the advanced economies. This theme formed the bulwark of President Trump’s election campaign, which espoused the thesis that trade protections will lead to greater domestic prosperity. \n\nWhile the liberalisation of trade barriers over the past 70 years resulted in considerable opening of global trade, the initial phase benefitted only the advanced economies. Exports/GDP for the advanced economies increased from 60 per cent in 1950 to 75 per cent by mid-1970, indicating that the advanced economies were the early gainers of trade liberalisation. \n\nHowever, during the 1990s and the subsequent decade, the equilibrium shifted considerably towards the developing markets, with their contribution to external trade and global economic growth rising sharply. \n\nThe share of developing Asian economies in global exports increased to 21 per cent by 1999 from 15 per cent in late 1980s. It ascended even further to 37 per cent by 2013. \n\nThe share of GDP coming from developing Asia has doubled to 29 per cent by 2017 from 2003; for the advanced economies, it has declined precipitously to 58 per cent from a steady level of 76-78 per cent during 1990-2004. \n\nThe US, which has been aggressively moving towards protectionism since GFC, has seen its contribution to global exports decline from 12 per cent in 2001 to 8 per cent in 2013. The share of the US GDP to global GDP has also declined from 32 per cent in 2002 to 22 per cent in 2014. \n\nIndeed, since GFC, the trade limiting policies implemented by G20 countries have quadrupled, resulting in stagnant global trade volume following a quick recovery from the initial shock from GFC. The narrowing growth differential of EMs vis-à-vis the global economy is symptomatic of the de-globalisation trend that is already underway. \n\nThe rising trend of protectionism is an extension of growing US concerns about global economic imbalance since 2006 and the intense pressure on China to abandon the currency peg. The undervalued yuan was seen to be aimed at enabling Chinese manufacturers to feed on the US demand, resulting in a widening US external deficit. While the US current account deficit (CAD) has declined from 6.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent in 2013, the recent cyclical growth revival has resulted in some retraction to 3.4 per cent in 2017. \n\nIn comparison, China’s current account surplus has declined from a high of 9 per cent in 2007 to 1.5 per cent in 2017. But, with China spreading its base of manufacturing across the world, reflected in the consistent rise in outward Chinese FDI, the decline in Chinese trade surplus and current account surplus is seen as deceptive. \n\nEmpirical experience from the 1970s and 1980s indicates that the inflection point for a complete global rebalancing was achieved in 1992-93, following ~10-13 years of adjustments and protective dispensations in the advanced economies, led by the US. At the inflection point in 1992, the trade in the advanced economies was completely balanced. On the other hand the trade surplus of the developing economies declined from a high of 4 per cent of GDP in 1979 to a deficit of 1.5 per cent in 1992. \n\nIn the current context, the global rebalancing still incomplete and the inflexion point is yet to be reached. \n\nUnlike the other phases of slow growth when global trade protectionism rises, the post GFC recovery looks fairly tentative. Importantly, while the US economy is seen by the Federal Reserve to be on a solid footing with an improving job market, compensation growth, strong consumption & investment demand, it appears to be mainly dependent on monetary as well as fiscal support. Also, the fiscal burden remains high, with total public debt/GDP at 104 per cent in 2017 – almost double the level it was prior to GFC at 60-62 per cent. Hence, the counter-cyclical buffer in major economies to fend off another economic crisis is inadequate. It therefore appears that the US is also trying to ring-fence its current growth recovery. \n\nFor India, further tightening in the global trade policy, slower growth in trade volume and decline in growth elasticity with respect to global trade are emerging as major challenges. The second and third order effects of resurgence in external trade through its multiplier effects on savings, investments, productivity , corporate performance, banking sector and employment generation make India highly dependent on a conducive global trade environment. \n\nDecline in trade openness has seen India responding with protectionism coupled with inward-looking policies, including increasing role of government in driving demand, supporting farm & rural sectors, job creation, housing for all and prioritising MSME lending for public sector banks (PSBs). This trend is expected to continue. Hence, it will also imply higher fiscal commitment. \n\nGenerally speaking, every 100bps decline in trade openness will lead to 100-120bps drop in sales growth of Indian companies. While trade openness benefits Indian companies, reduction in import tariff hurts them on the demand front because of competition from imports. Hence, increase in tariff rate can lead to improvement in the performance of select sectors. \n\nEarnings performance of Indian companies will depend on the strength of demand impetus from higher government spending, relative to rising cost of inputs in a trade protectionist environment. \n\nOur estimates indicate that an environment of restrictive global trade has an adverse impact on profit growth of Indian companies. Higher import tariffs can have a negative impact on earnings, by increasing the cost of inputs. Every 100bps decline in trade openness leads to 200bps impact on earnings growth and 100bps increase in average import duty can compress it by 130bps. \n\nThe impact of higher government spending is less significant and contrastingly it is negative. This is probably because of its counter-cyclical nature; higher spending is initiated during slowdown and vice versa. Alternately, higher public spending is also associated with higher tax on profits \n\nFrom the equity market’s standpoint, the contrasting combination of accommodative monetary and restrictive trade policy of advanced economies (AEs) since 2008, led by the US, possibly fuelled the paradox of declining earnings growth and all-time high equity market valuations. While the strengthening growth in the US and advanced economies has a positive implication for emerging market equities, a steeper rise in US inflation, hastened by trade protectionism, can prompt faster-than-anticipated normalisation of Fed’s monetary policy, thereby tightening financial market conditions for emerging markets. \n(Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer.

      "text": "The Over-the-top (OTT) market in India is beginning to see real traction with more competitors and new innovative platforms on the back of cheaper data bundles. Frost & Sullivan’s ‘Over-the-top (OTT) Video Services Market, India, 2017–2022’ covers the OTT market trends, drivers, growth, revenues in India, and much more.\nThe study reveals that the OTT video market in India is beginning to see real traction with more competitors and new innovative platforms on the back of cheaper data bundles. With 180.3 million active online video viewers and almost 4 million registered subscribers, the OTT video services market earned over Rs 37 billion in 2017, and will likely grow at a CAGR of 17.3 per cent over the next five years.\nThe OTT video market in India is gradually becoming a mainstream entertainment destination with the rapid rise in the internet user base. With the commoditisation of Internet and growth of mobile demography, many households are supplementing their television subscriptions with multiple OTT video platforms. The inclusion of regional content by vernacular-specific platforms has paved the way for a mass-market adoption as opposed to the erstwhile niche offerings catering to urban households. Live sports and other marquee titles offered online have reiterated the growth opportunity of OTT video, encouraging global internet companies to invest and enter this lucrative market.\n“The customer experience and user interface need to be prioritised by an operator to stand a chance in this market. Exclusive, original programming and live content will give an edge to some platforms that can afford to offer such services. Platforms with vernacular options will strike a chord with the masses, capturing audiences beyond urban areas. The market is just waking up to the subscription video on demand (SVOD) proposition, and it will have more takers in the next five years,” said Aafia Bathool, Research Analyst, Digital Media Practice, Frost & Sullivan .\nAs seen in other regional markets, Bathool finds that telcos are using OTT video services extensively as a bundling strategy for attracting and retaining their consumers. The study highlights growing partnerships among telecom operators, handset OEMs and distributors, FMCG brands, and content aggregators. The study also outlines investment and funding in the market, as well as an extensive competitive analysis of leading platforms, based on their feature sets and content strategies.\nHowever, India continues to be challenged by inadequate broadband infrastructure. Despite an increase in adoption of 4G services across India, consumers often report slow access and inconsistent speeds, thereby affecting the quality of experience. This has led to significant churn across service providers. The other challenge that market participants have to contend with is low ARPUs in subscription based services.\n“As a result of aggressive pricing and bundling strategies by companies such as Amazon (through Prime) and ALTBalaji, the ARPU for SVOD services in India fell to Rs 65 in 2017. Among freemium model platforms, service providers are seeing conversion of only about 2 per cent of viewers from advertisement-based video on demand (AVOD) to SVOD, clearly establishing a dominance of AVOD-based business models in the long term,” observed Vidya S Nath, Senior Research Director, Digital Media Practice, Frost & Sullivan .\nFrom 2018 to 2020, OTT platforms will be focused on acquiring content rights to vernacular videos and sports; while telecom operators will focus on bundling or acquiring the increasingly popular OTT platforms.\n“The market will be dominated by the global incumbents with heavy capital to invest, as the smaller, regional platforms learn the ropes and learn to strategise optimally in the market. Monetisation of SVOD platforms will take off with skinny bundles and promotional packages from OEMs and telcos. Content preferences are gradually shifting toward longer-form content, indicating the increased time spent on OTT platforms,” said Bathool.",

The major indices of the Indian stock markets were range-bound on Wednesday and closed with marginal gains over Tuesday’s close. On the NSE, there were 612 advances, 916 declines and 50 unchanged. The trends of the major indices in the course of Wednesday’s trading are given in the table below:\n Global software major Wipro and India's largest public sector lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday committed transitioning their respective global fleets into electric vehicles by 2030. Both became the first major Indian businesses to join the international non-profit organisation, The Climate Group's, global electric vehicles initiative, EV100, for accelerating the roll-out of electric vehicles worldwide. Airline major Jet Airways said that it will not participate in the divestment process of national carrier Air India. \"We welcome the government move to privatise Air India. It is a bold step. \"However, considering the terms of offer in the information memorandum and based on our review, we are not participating in the process,\" Amit Agarwal, Deputy CEO and CFO, Jet Airways was Quote: d in a statement. The development assumes significance as it comes days after another airline IndiGo on April 5 had said that it will not bid for Air India under the \"current divestiture plans\". Jet Airways had never officially said that it was interested in Air India, but IndiGo had earlier expressed its interest in the acquiring Air India's international operations and Air India Express (AIXL). The Central government has invited \"Expression of Interest\" to off-load 76% stake and management control of the airline. On April 5, IndiGo's President and Whole Time Director Aditya Ghosh had said: \"From day one, IndiGo has expressed its interest primarily in the acquisition of Air India's international operations and Air India Express. However, that option is not available under the government's current divestiture plans for Air India. Jet Airways shares closed at Rs617.75, down 0.50% on the NSE and InterGlobe Aviation shares closed at Rs1,482.90, up 0.35% on the NSE. After the market closed, President Trump warned on developments in Syria and America’s planned firm response. President Donald Trump said relations with Russia are worse than they have ever been and warned the country to \"get ready\" because a volley of U.S. missiles would soon be sent into Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack, according to Bloomberg Quint. “Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart!,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!” This international political turbulence could lead to caution among investors worldwide including India and there could be bearish trends.

Ayan Pramanik | ET Bureau | April 11, 2018, 14:17 IST Newsletter A A BENGALURU: IT services major Cognizant offered single-digit hike in compensation to its key executives including chief executive officer Francisco D’Souza in 2017 considering the market trends.Compensations of the company’s top three executives - D’Souza, Rajeev Mehta , President, and Karen McLoughlin,chief financial officer - were raised between 3 and 8% last year.Both D’Souza and Mehta have not received any hike in base salary and annual cash incentive.The chief executive received 3% overall increase in target direct compensation as against 2016 to reflect general market trends and the compensation was set close to median but weighted more heavily towards equity compensation versus company peer group, providing the opportunity for higher realized compensation based on company performance, said the company in its proxy statement filed to the USSEC.D’Souza’s target direct compensation was $12.23 million in 2017 and annual performance stock units (PSU) and restricted stock units (RSU) grants increased by 3% over 2016.Mehta, who was given 14% increase upon his promotion to President in September 2016, received a 3% overall increase in target direct compensation. His annual PSU and RSU grants increased by 3% and 4%, respectively from 2016.McLoughlin received 8% overall increase in target direct compensation for 2017 to align compensation to market and her base salary and annual cash incentive increased by 17% over 2016. She received 5% and 6% hike respectively in annual PSU and RSU grants.The IT services industry is passing through a major transformation as more organisations are shifting towards use of digital technologies globally and this has impacted growth of companies such as Cognizant, Infosys , TCS and others.Ramakrishna Prasad Chintamaneni executive vice-president and President, Global Industries and Consulting, saw his target direct compensation being raised 31% at the time of his promotion to his current role in December 2016 and there was no further changes made in 2017.Cognizant said that compensations for executives were set primarily based on the company’s performance during 2017, 2016 and in previous years and its growth compared with industry; anticipated and desired company performance for 2017 and 2018 based on company and industry projections and company goals; individual executive performance and responsibility and the market for executive talent.

      "text": "Tweet \nDemographics of technology owners will determine the type of intervention in post modern HR, while an entirely different set of experts will use this to optimally influence business and people processes. Adopting diverse statistical tools and data gathering methodologies has now become the easy part in Human Resource Management. How you use analytics to drive HR issues and decisions, is critical to business. As predictive, cognitive, descriptive & prescriptive tools penetrate areas of HR, the important piece to consider is the decision making process that will follow. \nAnalytics go beyond stating past data to assess how fundamental certain tendencies are and what they could imply going forward. Smart organisations need expertise to use analytics methodology and technology effectively. People analytics influences business strategy and growth by supporting business strategy to revenue growth. This can be done by predicting talent requirements and focusing on where your highly contributing talent is located, while also identifying potential talent that will support growth. Further, analytics can forecast potential leadership gaps and help develop succession pipelines to protect the business from the vulnerabilities of skill deficiency. People analytics can influence top line, sales growth and cost by combining with customer and pricing data which can improve the way you organise and develop human capital. Analytics can provide analysis of spend on people and ROI by using compensation, employee and financial data.Companies can also study demographic, education and experience considerations that link with high performing sales staff. People analytics helps in attrition management. Deloitte’s global HR trends report tells us that 71% of surveyed executives see people analytics as a high priority and are applying it to talent challenges. People analytics can help retain top talent by proactively predicting attrition risk and identifying cost-effective programs to get people to stay. People analytics supports performance Management as it helps create profiles for employees with a higher likelihood of succeeding in particular roles. Certain machine learning–based analysis can predict financial performance of branch and team structures and highlight how a few roles can have an effect on business success. As a result, HR can build new organization structures. This process also dispels notions about who the “right people for the right jobs” are. Effective and efficient hiring is the use of advanced automation. HR can reduce costs associated with resume-screening process and improve selection effectiveness. When HR links hiring criteria to an analytics model successfully, it can identify those candidates likely to be employed by them and automatically move them on to the next stage of the recruiting process without having to analyse heaps of data. \nAs we know, the role of HR is to focus on interpersonal relationships in the workplace which can be difficult to assess based only on metrics. \nIt is known that Google tries to assimilate human aspects via the use of people analytics. By integrating quantitative and qualitative data, they enable leaders to unravel the company’s culture dynamics. They have used people analytics to improve the workplace across a number of studies and most decisions the company takes is data-driven. While many HR organizations are still struggling to gather and organise their data while simultaneously building teams, the argument for using of People Analytics is compelling. \nThe writer is Purvi Sheth, CEO, Shilputsi Consultants ",

      "text": "FMCG major ITC is eyeing 10 to 12 per cent market share in the packed juices and fruit beverages segment by next year as the company bets on its 'not from concentrate' range of juices, said a top company official.\n\nITC would continue to add more flavours in B Natural 's portfolio and plans to add 4-5 new variants in next few months. Besides, the Kolkata-headquarted company is also looking to tap the export market.\n\n\"We believe that we should get double-digit market share of the juices by next year,\" ITC Divisional Chief Executive, Foods Division Hemant Malik told PTI.\n\nAccording to the company, B Natural is a Rs 100-crore brand at present, and is growing 25 per cent annually. ITC has around 7 per cent share in the juices and fruit beverages market, which is estimated to be around Rs 2,500 crore.\n\nThe market is growing 13 to 14 per cent annually and is dominated by players like Pepsico's Tropicana and Dabur 's Real, the company said.\n\nAs per its strategy, ITC has now shifted away from making juices from concentrates, which are mostly imported, and is now leveraging strength of its agri division to directly source fruits from farmers and convert pulps into juices.\n\n\"This will lead to sourcing of over 2.5 lakh tonnes of fresh fruits directly from Indian farmers annually instead of importing concentrates,\" said Malik.\n\nGlobally, the trend is moving towards not-from-concentrate based juices, and in markets as US, it is sold at 30 per cent premium, he added.\n\n\"We have 13 products and now our entire range would be made not from concentrate and fruits sourced from the domestic market,\" said Malik.\n\nIt is also strengthening the distribution network of B Natural and would focus on small tier III markets, which have also started consuming packed juices, besides tier I & II places.\n\n\"We are using our distribution strength to expand availability across both rural and urban markets,\" he said.\n\nBesides ITC has also started exporting B Natural to Middle East targeting the Indian diaspora and is looking at markets as US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe company is also spending on branding and promotions substantially, he said, without disclosing the numbers.

      "text": "Charts Valuation & Peer Comparison Community Buzz PEER COMPANIES In a chat with ET Now, Mayuresh Joshi , Fund Manager, Angel Broking, says Q4 might be a little bit on the softer side barring a few sectors. Focus will be on sectors where earnings growth will continue in excess of 14-15%. Edited excerpts: Should minority shareholders tender their shares in Fortis at Rs 155 or someone who is patient should be actually resisting this offer because the face of Fortis in two-three years could change dramatically and it will be much more valuable franchise? For the industry as a whole, the dynamics remains in favour of all the hospital players. The kind of opportunities that these players have, specifically in lieu of lack of hospital facilities and kind of additions that they are doing plus the medical tourism concept is going to probably abet their earnings growth and keep the sector in good momentum. Specifically in case of Fortis, we have got no direct coverage but whatever has happened and the deal that has probably got sweetened does benefit. But to what extent? It really depends in terms of two aspects – A) the deal probably looks far more lucrative at this point of time but the other angle is probably the operating parameters which should improve significantly. Again, it can be a good offer to be taken but largely what we probably like within the space still continues to be Apollo Hospitals , even though the valuations are on the higher side. New hospitals have started contributing and the contribution from the pharmacy part of the business on the EBIT level which has started breaking even also inspires a lot of confidence. Apollo probably remains one of our preferred picks within the space. How are you participating in this market? What are you buying? Where are you locking some gains? What has been the tone of activity at your end? Our participation in market depends on two factors. a) the crude movement that you are probably seeing spiking up is obviously going to push up both the yield movement and again CPI inflation. If it sustains above 70 odd dollars, you definitely have some issues at hand both from a macro perspective and select user industry which possibly uses crude or crude oil derivatives. Input cost inflation probably starts moving higher and so paint companies, then tyre companies are the spaces that need to be monitored very closely.b) The second angle obviously is corporate earnings. Our focus is largely on sector/companies where earnings momentum can probably continue. Q4 might be a little bit on the softer side barring a few sectors. We will focus on sectors where earnings growth will continue in excess of 14-15%. Selective retail private banks and few of the corporate facing banks is something that we continue liking though the price to book parameter for retail banks might be higher. The growth also looks far sharper there and the asset quality pressures look to be far lesser and abating compared to the corporate or the PSU structure. The second element in terms of government spending on infrastructure I think that is one key focus area that we probably like. Select players within the road EPC players which have bagged HAM contracts where the IRRs will be far better over the next few quarters and years. As execution improves, the earnings parameter should improve on that count as well. We like Dilip Buildcon, KNR Construction, Sadbhav Engineering . With order flows, the growth momentum is here to stay. Consumption as a basket and looks very interesting and within the large components. select auto names is something that we continue to chase. We also probably like a few of the NBFCs. Even the yield movement has been sharp. You are probably seeing some dip happening because of the government borrowing programme, the RBI inflation trajectory. Some of the NBFCs will continue to doing well. So Chola, DHFL is something that we continue liking. Within the defensives, we are a little bit selective in both IT and pharma. A few largecap IT names like Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, maybe within the midcap space Nucleus Software is a dark horse candidate that we probably can pursue and pharma is very selective in terms of what two companies can deliver. Ipca Labs and Alkem Labs is something that we continue to like. What do you expect in terms of Infy guidance? Other than Wipro, Infy is the only company which lays out a very definitive guidance which highlights global IT revenue growth. What are you hoping to hear? The hope is probably what it has probably delivered over the last few quarters. A higher single digit tall revenue growth is something to be watched out for. EBIT margins are expected to be probably in the same range. To that extent, the management commentary specifically in terms of revival within the BFSI space is going to be very critical for companies like Infosys and TCS because almost 30-32% of the revenues come from this segment and it is a major revenue driver for these companies. Now, with the kind of digital transformational deals that they have done in the past and the digital investments that they have put into all these businesses along with utilisation levels remaining far more stable and the benefit of cross currency is probably aiding their EBIT margins this time around. Any positive commentary surrounding the BFSI space and the order momentum outlook is probably going to give some amount of momentum to the sector as a whole. We are expecting a reasonable amount of commentary to come through both from Infosys and TCS, both in terms of the digital deal wins that they probably can attain from this segment. Retail and manufacturing obviously have been encouraging trends. Cognizant in their concall last time around, gave indication of some turnaround. This can be taken as a positive but probably they also need to understand the impact that might come through post wage hikes this quarter. You are probably going to look at some amount of stickiness when it comes to the overall structuring within the euro zone itself. We remain selective on the top names but commentary is generally in my opinion should be far more reasonable this time around. Do you believe that there is value on the table now that there have been management changes at Axis and there is talk of perhaps ICICI Bank being next in the pipeline? Are these stocks now worth a buy? We still have maintained our ratings on the stock which is a hold in spite of what has happened in terms of developments, specifically related to the managements of these banks. Loan growth specifically in terms of de-risking their entire portfolio has been very strong towards the retail side of their business. Their retail advances have grown at a very fast clip. Again, the asset quality pressure specifically on their corporate mid SME or MSME book has largely played out with their drill-down watch list dwindling over the past few quarters. There was a recognition of the fact that accelerated provisioning took a hit on their credit cost. Can that continue for the next quarter that is this quarter and the next? Absolutely possible. Does that mean that credit costs are not going to come down significantly over a period of time? My view is that they should probably peak off over the next quarter or two and start dwindling down. The third aspect is core valuations. If you look at their banking valuations except their subsidiaries, they are trading at very reasonable valuations. As credit growth picks up in the system more meaningfully and because of their strong capital adequacy, the balance sheet expansion can re-rate these stocks in terms of ROAs and ROEs. I think the hold rating probably continues from our side for both these corporate facing banks. If you have to pick one commodity stock for next one year out of the current offering of ferrous and non-ferrous and even other metals, what will you buy and in one line, why? I am still favouring Vedanta at this point of time because zinc is 56 odd per cent of their business and zinc prices as per our commodity analysts are expected to remain extremely strong and buoyant. The other element in terms of their operating costs towards the aluminium business remains quite on the higher side. A large element of these costs are actually starting to come down over the next few quarters. If there is any scope in terms of captive mining, that will reduce the cost of borrowing for this sort of business even more. The oil and gas business probably is at an optimum level in terms of the cost of production and though the PAC with government is still on, the oil and gas business also has far stronger dynamics going ahead, a very strong balance sheet, significant dividend yield and earnings trajectory expected to remain buoyant. So I think Vedanta probably remains one of our preferred pick. The oil and gas space with oil on the boil, not too hot but is getting there, do you think that one would be looking at the oil and gas space once again. ONGC of course seems to be an opportunity whenever oil prices go up for a direct correlation there but oil marketing companies in lieu of whether or not they can pass on the burden to the end consumer, there might be some concern on some caution. It is a possibility and if it crosses $70 a barrel and stays above that or at higher levels, what you are probably seeing is in terms of the exchequer allocating a certain amount in terms of the fuel subsidy. The oil marketing companies or the upstream companies need to probably then bear the component of that. The second element if it stays in this range obviously is that upstream companies like ONGC, Oil India do benefit because the gross realisations that they probably derive from crude sales directly passes on and because there is no under recoveries of subsidy sharing I think it is a net pass through in terms of that entire gross realisations being the net realisations for the companies. For OMCs, the story becomes a lot more different in terms of escalating crude prices. The margins, specifically the marketing margins both on petrol and diesel that probably comes a little bit under the question mark and the second element in terms of the pass through effect I think it is a little bit difficult in terms of how we will able to that. Dynamic pricing is in but after a certain level, there has to be some amount of bearing that most of these companies either need to do considering the constraints that even the central government will have on its budgeted allocations. Again, as a space our belief is that oil should not significantly move higher than $70 for the entire part of the year and the rupee should not depreciate significantly because these are two key variables. Having said that, the kind of cash flows that they can generate if one presumes oil between $60-68, it can be quite significant to fuel their expansion and protect the refining margins. So somewhere down the line, my own belief is any significant decline on to a stock like IOC probably becomes our preferred pick because of the diversified model both in pipeline, the downside the petchem projects and even the refining part of the business with their Paradip operations are running at full. 0 Comments ",

      "title": "The true stories behind these Malayalam films",
      "text": "The true stories behind these Malayalam films The true stories behind these Malayalam films Did you know that Swathanthryam Ardharathriyil, Pulimurugan and Angamaly Diaries are based on real life stories? | Apr 11, 2018, 00:00 IST The Malayalam film industry has been transforming like never before in the past few years, and one of the major changes is the advent of real life stories as themes in films, and/or a realistic approach in the making. Filmmakers attribute this trend to the changing tastes of the audience, who now prefer to see content they are familiar with on screen, rather than something completely improbable. Following Kamal’s Celluloid in 2013, a series of biopics including Aami and Captain made their entry, of Madhavikutty and footballer V P Sathyan respectively, while films like Ennu Ninte Moideen, Jacobinte Swargarajyam and Vimaanam were cinematic versions of real-life stories. But not many would know that a lot of other much discussed films were also based on true stories. Unlike in the case of the above mentioned movies, the real life characters of these movies often aren’t even aware that a movie has been made on them, or that it has been a hit. We take a look at some of them. Pulimurugan The actual story : Pulimurugan is not based on one person’s story but on similar hunters, actually tribals who live in forest borders across Kerala, says Udayakrishna, the film’s scriptwriter. “I grew up hearing many such stories. They know exactly how to dodge wild animals, and usually kill them only for a reason. But there was one particular story which hooked me, which was narrated to me by a forest range officer from Attappady. This hunter had a particular way of catching the tiger. They know that the tiger will eat its prey only three days after killing it. So he waited by the dead prey and killed the tiger by hitting it with his rifle’s handle.” Unlike in the movie, the hunter killed the tiger for its skin, and was later caught by the forest officers and handed over to the police, he adds. The film is set in an imaginary town called Puliyoor, and it’s not the Puliyoor near Pooyamkutti, he discloses. Real vs fiction : “Real life stories always have a special feel, and the viewers get the same feel as they watch the films. They exude the fragrance of life like nothing else can, and anyone who lives near a mountain range would be able to connect with the lives of people like Pulimurugan. When combined with cinematic elements, they make great hits too. The best part of watching Dangal was the note at the end which said that it is based on a true story,” says Udayakrishna. Current status of the real-life characters : Living anonymously in the forests of Attappady. Swathanthryam Ardharathriyil The actual story: The recently released thriller tells the story of a motley gang of prisoners who plot a smooth escape from jail. The story, says its director Tinu Pappachan , is based on the real-life characters that the scriptwriter, Dileep Kurian, came across. “Dileep works in a finance company, like the protagonist Jacob Varghese. For the sake of the film, he met some prisoners at the Kottayam sub-jail, spoke to them and studied them. The setting is an exact replica of the Kottayam sub-jail and the characters a fictionalised version of the prisoners he spoke to. I too visited jails in Kottayam, Pala and Thrissur and observed the routine and habits of the remand prisoners. We also interacted with the policemen who were very helpful,” says Tinu. However, the spectacular jailbreak in the film is entirely fictional. Real vs fiction : “I feel a real-life story will always have an edge over pure imagination,” says Tinu. “It could be because a viewer might feel that this is something that could happen in his life and can thus relate better with the characters.” Current status of the real-life characters: There is little chance that the actual prisoners know that the film is based on them, says Tinu. “However, since they are all remand prisoners, they could have been given bail any time, and there are chances that some of them might have even watched the movie.” Mayaanadhi The actual story : Aashiq Abu’s Mayaanadhi essentially spoke of man-woman relationships in urban Kerala today, but the story line had the protagonist on the run, while the police make use of his girlfriend to nab him. The thread, says Dileesh Nair, one of the scriptwriters, is based on a true story which Amal Neerad came across during his Mumbai days. “The story was relayed to Amal by a police officer, an encounter specialist. While Tovino and Aishwarya Lekshmi are two urban college students who later try to make their own careers in the film, the original person was a Mumbai gangster and his girlfriend, a sex worker. She betrays him to the police intentionally, unlike in the film, and he is shot in an encounter,” says the scriptwriter. The final movie is thus a lot different from the original, the script writer says. “We wanted to explore male-female politics in urban life. Women living alone and single mothers were all added later.” Real vs fiction : For a film with a realistic approach, a real-life story is always better, according to Dileesh. “Because we don’t need to add cinematic drama.” However, there is no such thing as a true story being better than fiction, he hastens to add. “Every filmmaker will have their own favourite story-telling method and it is up to them to make the film they want.” Current status of the real-life characters : The real incidents behind Mayaanadhi happened years ago, and the filmmakers haven’t even seen the real life couple, says Dileesh. “The gangster is of course, dead and we have no idea what happened to the sex worker.” Angamaly Diaries The actual story : Angamaly Diaries with its ‘katta local’ settings and slang had a real-life ring to it all through and not surprisingly, it is based on several incidents which actually happened in Angamaly, reveals its director Lijo Jose Pellissery. The film’s writer Chemban Vinod is someone who grew up in Angamaly and the incidents in the film were all those he had seen or heard about in his neighbourhood, says Lijo. “We have added our imagination, of course but the basics are real. I also live nearby. The names we used for the characters are all those of living or dead people. The scenes involving pigs were shot in real farms in the area,” he says. Real vs fiction : Lijo feels that the tastes of the Malayali audience have changed. “More than pure entertainers, people enjoy stories which could happen around them.” Current status of the real-life characters: Still living in Angamaly Parole The actual story : Sharrath Sandith’s film is about a man named Alex who is in prison for life. After eight years, Alex, who is let out on parole, tries to re-build his relationship with his family. The real-life Alex, says Sharrath, was someone its scriptwriter Ajith Poojappura knew in person. “Ajith was a prison officer earlier and the story is based on his experiences dealing with him. Ajith interacted with the person for months and this script is not at all fictional.” The names of the characters in the film, like Bullet Raghavan and Kottaram Vasu, are also of real people, apparently. However, there has been an enhancement in the presentation, Sharrath says. “We didn’t want to do a raw film and wanted an entertainer with a pleasant, feel-good factor. So we made some changes to the script.” Real vs fiction : A real story has a ring of genuineness to it, an undercurrent of real emotions, and that is what attracted him to the script, says Sharrath. Current status of the real-life characters: “The real Alex is still in prison. He hasn’t seen the film, neither does he know about it.” Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App . Download The Times of India news app for your device.

      "text": "Discovery Kids has joined hands with Rohit Shetty Picturez and Reliance Animation, a Reliance Entertainment company, to launch its latest animation series – ‘Little Singham’. The kids’ channel is leaving no stone unturned to create a huge buzz for the series, which is inspired by popular supercop brand and one of the biggest Bollywood blockbusters starring Ajay Devgn in the titular character.\n‘Little Singham’ will have 156 episodes and 5 tele-features. The animation series will be aired in 3 languages – Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. Dabur Red Paste has come on-board as the title sponsor of ‘Little Singham’.\nMeanwhile, Discovery India has also tied up with the Indian Council for Child Welfare National Bravery Awards to inspire young children across the country. As part of this tie-up, Discovery Kids will run a special ‘Little Singham’ episode based on the real-life stories of ICCW National Bravery Award winners.\nAccording to Uttam Pal Singh, Head of Discovery Kids , “The kids’ genre in India has been largely devoid of ground-up Super Heroes. ‘Little Singham’ is a very bold and at scale attempt to fill this gap. We have worked with a world class animation partner Reliance Animation to produce this masala faceted series rooted in action, adventure and comedy to attract attention of kids across the country.”\nIn conversation with Adgully, Uttam Pal Singh speaks at length about the growth of the kids’ genre in India, how ‘Little Singham’ intends to fill in the gap in the genre, the marketing strategy and much more. Excerpts:\nHow has Discovery Kids evolved as a brand over the last 6 years?\nDiscovery Kids has gone through a reinvention. Initially, we used to focus more on entertainment, but now, one can see that a lot of changes have happened in the kids’ genre. This category has also grown. Right now it is placed at No. 3 after GECs and Movies. Children themselves have made this genre strong enough.\nTalking about Discovery Kids, in order to be more competitive we thought of reinventing ourselves. And with the new content line-up that we have, which includes ‘Bandbudh aur Budbak’ and ‘Little Singham’, we have already entered the competitive zone. We have grown almost over 200 per cent in the kids’ genre in ratings in the past two months.\nWhat programming changes have you done for Discovery Kids?\nWe are focussing more on entertainment content now. For us, it is very important to understand what kids’ enjoy this time of the year (the summer days). We have been doing extensive consumer research/ kids’ research for the last few years to better understand what kind of content really appeals to them.\nHow was the idea of ‘Little Singham’ developed?\nWe came across three major findings while we had our conducted research. Kids need something which is engaging, influencing and related to mythology. And for me, Bollywood is something that influences everybody and that’s why we got this show on board.\nCould you tell us about your association with Reliance Animation?\nReliance Animation and Discovery Kids are the co-producers, which means we are part owners of everything, including the content and the businesses that go around it. The main ‘Singham’ IP is with Reliance, but for the IP for ‘Little Singham’, we are the co-owners.\nHow long will the licensing tenure with Reliance last?\nIt’s not a perfect platform to announce that. But, having said that, Reliance is an animation studio and is doing great business in licensing, while we are a strong broadcaster – hence, the synergies of both the partners are matching up greatly.\nHow are you creating buzz for the new series through marketing and promotions?\nI think with Rohit Shetty coming in and his association with this show itself is creating a lot buzz out there.\nWill you also tap into the merchandising possibilities?\nRight now, our only focus is to make this character works great. We want to create awareness amongst kids to come and sample the show and only later on will we have a line-up for merchandising.\nWhat are your plans to acquire new IPs for Discovery Kids in 2018?\nThis IP of ‘Little Singham’ itself is so big, and if you look at the current trend in the competition, they have one or two IPs and they run the show on it. For Discovery, we never had such a powerful IP, but with ‘Little Singham’, we are fully ready.\nHow do you intend to maintain your uniqueness in a competitive field?\nThe best part of ‘Little Singham’ is that he is so relevant; it’s a Make-in-India show and kids can connect with him instantly. And for me, that’s its biggest strength. Currently, the industry is looking for more animated content and some top IP shows, and Discovery Kids is reinventing with ‘Little Singham’. It’s an Indian IP.\nKids these days are more fascinated with cartoons on digital. What are your plans to take ‘Little Singham’ on digital?\nThat’s absolutely true. We have already discussed that initially, the show will rest primarily on linear channel, but after 3-4 months one can watch it on Netflix as well. Apart from this, Discovery Kids is planning to create its own OTT app, where we will include a lot of content and ‘Little Singham’ will be a part of that. We have not really set a date for that, but we are working on this. We, too, have noticed this growing digital trend and that’s why we want to be relevant in both linear and OTT space.\nFor kids’ channels, do you think the advertising phenomenon has changed?\nYes, it has changed. But more than a broadcaster, I think that it’s an industry call. For me, the genre has developed a lot and today you can’t afford to avoid it. And with that I think the situation will change.\nAccording to BARC data, which are the markets that see a high number of viewership in the kids’ genre?\nFor us, HSM is a really big market. In the South, Tamil Nadu, Chennai and Andhra Pradesh are really big markets for us. That’s why we have added those language feeds.",

      "text": "If Congress wins Karnataka, BJP revolt will take the shape of a tsunami \nCONVICTION rates under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, have been below 10 per cent in Maharashtra since 2013, according to data from the Maharashtra Police. But data accessed by The Indian Express under the Right to Information Act also shows that the state has witnessed a little dip in false cases or B-Summary cases registered under the \nUntil February this year, conviction rate stood at 6.93 per cent, only a little better than 2017’s 5.95 per cent. In 2016, the year of the Maratha rallies, seeking dilution of the Atrocities Act, conviction rate was marginally higher at 7.07 per cent. \nIn the last three years, the B-Summary cases have been between 8 and 10 per cent. Until February, this year, of the 312 cases chargesheeted by the police, 27 cases (8.65 per cent) were found to be false complaints. In 2017, of the 1,637 cases chargesheeted, 160 (9.77 per cent) were found to be fake. In 2016, of the 1,814 cases chargesheeted, 196 cases (10.80 percent) had B Summary reports filed. The B Summary is filed as per the Code of Criminal Procedure when cases are false, malicious, frivolous or where no evidence is available. \nUnder the Protection of Civil Rights (PCR) Act, 1955, another special law to safeguard the rights of the SC/ST community, conviction rate in 2017 and until February this year was zero per cent. Amid the nationwide agitations over the provisions of the Atrocities Act, statistics related to these two laws reveal two trends in the state — acquittals in 90 per cent of cases over the last three years, and that only in about 3 per cent of offences is the Atrocities Act solely invoked while the remaining cases see the law read with other offences under the IPC. \nTill February in this year, of the 225 cases under the Atrocities Act in the state, 202 saw acquittals. In 2017, of the 1,527 cases decided by the courts, 1,362 ended in acquittals. In 2016, of the 1,431 cases decided, there were acquittals in 1,293 cases. Similarly, under PCR Act, until February this year, two cases decided by the cases ended in acquittal. In 2017, of the 30 cases decided by the courts, 28 saw acquittals. In 2016, of 91 cases decided, 86 cases ended in accused being acquitted. \nOne of the biggest challenges for police and prosecution in these cases is witnesses turning hostile, said officials. Last year, nearly 35 per cent of the cases failed to secure conviction on account of hostile witnesses, a trend the police is now trying to reverse by offering protection to witnesses. Prominent Dalit author Chandrabhan Prasad says that social pressure is one of the main reasons for witnesses turning hostile, or complainants withdrawing cases. “Dalits constitute a social minority, around 10 per cent of the total population in Maharashtra. The pressure on the Dalit member, be it a witness or a complainant starts the very day he/she lodges a complaint,” he told The Indian Express. \nIn order to improve its conviction rate, the PCR Cell, a specialised wing of the Maharashtra Police, is now training its men on handling the cases. “We now have commenced training programmes, where we sensitise officers on the provisions of the Act. The primary aim is to improve the conviction rate and in cases where trials are stuck owing to various delays, to address those,” said Special Inspector General of Police, PCR, Quaiser Khalid. \nMeanwhile, there has been a slump in number of cases registered under the two Acts. Until February this year, 400 cases were registered. In 2017, there were 2,153 cases registered, in 2016 this number was a slightly higher at 2,159.

TIME????\nTravelingtheworld61 · 328 forum posts\nDenver, Colorado\n10 Apr 2018, 01:25\nI was reading another thread about visiting the Palace and it has me wondering something. The first time I visited Versailles was about 18 years ago and I have photos of my husband and I in the Hall of Mirrors with no one else in the photos! I've been back two more times with the last time being the last time I will ever go to Versailles. It was wall to wall people and I thought I was going to get crushed to death. And, this was in January.\nWhy so many people? Is it because more people are visiting Paris ? Or, something else?\nReply\n26 replies\nSort by:\nJHH36 · 10 Apr 2018, 17:56\nPalo Alto, California · 3,291 forum posts\n#21 of 26 ·\nThe world's population had increased by over a billion people since 2000. So we have billions more people today than we had in the 1980s, technological ease of travel with advances in aviation, and social media to show everyone where we have been and what to see. And then to top it off, 2017 was a record year for tourism in Paris in terms of the number of visitors. I am surprised Versailles is not more crowded than it is.\nReply\nJanettravels44 · 10 Apr 2018, 19:33\nChicago, Illinois · 26,762 forum posts\n#22 of 26 ·\nthe Alhambra doesn't have this problem because they limit ticket sales. This means lots of people arrive in Granada unaware that they won't be able to get access because they didn't reserve well in advance (and of course there are grifters who buy up and resell at high prices to cater to the ill prepared market. Versailles doesn't do this, they just keep cramming people in. I'd give it a pass unless it is extremely important to you to see it. We did the gardens on a fountain day in October a couple of years ago and that was delightful, but I won't be going back to the Chateau which we saw 25 years ago when it was much less crowded. You can see Fontainebleau , Vaux Le Vicomte and several other chateaux near Paris without lines or crowds.\njanettravels44\nwww.janettravels.wordpress.com\nReply\nHamlet478 · Edited: Apr 10, 2018, 2:48 PM\nSouth Hamilton, Massachusetts · 330 forum posts\n#23 of 26 ·\nThe selfie-bucket list culture doesn't help either. How many among the throngs around Mona Lisa have ever heard the [hrase \"atmospheric perspective\"?\nWe went to Versailles in May 2016. We arrived early on a Friday morning, the line to get in was maybe three deep. I could have sworn we were that right at opening. Barely a tour bus to be seen. And yet when we got into the Chateau, it was incredibly packed. I just don't get it. Is it badly managed flow?\nThe growth of travel has been exponential in the past 25 years. In September 1993, on our honeymoon, my wife and I didn't have room reservations for more than half of our two weeks in Italy (the very thought scares me today). One day in Tuscany we saw the towers of San Gimignano in the distance. We decided to explore and ended up driving right into the center of the town, the Piazza della Cisterna . We parked outside the Hotel Leon Bianco , and got a room for the night -- overlooking the piazza. Today, driving into SG is inconceivable -- you have to park down with a the tour buses and hoof it. And late September, when we got married, USED to be a nice shoulder season. Not anymore.\nFor the record, I don't get the Catacombs either. But if it draws all those visitors away from more interesting parts of Paris, hey, more power to it.\nReply\nJanettravels44 · Edited: Apr 10, 2018, 3:30 PM\nChicago, Illinois · 26,762 forum posts\n#24 of 26 ·\nHamlet -- we hiked the Cinque Terre before Rick Steves ruined it. It was enchanting. We were the only Americans and the only people we saw on the trail all day outside of a field trip of Italian 14 year olds. When we got to the end, we met a group of half a dozen German hikers going the other way. It was a stunning, untouched place with nary a souvenir shop in sight. We were in Volpaia with zero evidence of tourists -- Those days are long gone. I feel lucky that we saw so much before the era of mass tourism.\nPlaces like Versailles should change with the times and one of the changes would be to manage crowd size.\nReply\nEuromanic · 10 Apr 2018, 20:34\nParis, France · 5,891 forum posts\n#25 of 26 ·\nParis set a new record for tourism last year. There are more and more affluent tourists coming from countries previously too poor to provide many tourists. These countries contain billions of people, so the number of tourists is growing dramatically and the upward trend will continue for the foreseeable future.\nSince the capacity of tourist attractions is limited, overcrowding is inevitable. It's affecting popular tourist destinations around the world. It's just that Paris is first on the list.\nReply\nfifitrain · 10 Apr 2018, 21:09\nLeiden, The Netherlands · 4,089 forum posts\n#26 of 26 ·\nWe went to Versailles on Wednesday 26th 2017 for a 9:00am King's Apartment Tour (in French - the English KAT sold out by the time I'd got round to booking). There was a queue for tickets that stretched from the ticket office to just outside the main entrance gates, but we just went to the entrance for the KAT on the right hand side...\nThe KAT took us through a lot of the areas open to the general public in order to get to the private areas - I found the private Chapel the best part. But we were also taken through the Hall of Mirrors, which, while busy was not packed and it was fairly easy to move through.\nThe KAT finished in one of the rooms upstairs where we returned the earpieces - it was like one of the dining rooms or something, not a special area set aside for picking up and returning earpieces. Then we were lleft to do our own thing.\nYou can, in effect leave the KAT at any point but probably best to do when moving in one of the general public areas and not in the private apartments/rooms.\nWe also went early to Giverny on Thursday 27th July 2017 - probably arrived about 10:00am - it too was fairly quiet there as well. I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of crowds at both locations. Don't know if we were just lucky or my impression of a crowd is different from others\nPS. I'm not sure if I actually got round to thanking everyone for their help in planning this aspect of my trip last year - much appreciated. Been going to Paris for the weekend annually to see the Tour de France final every year since 2003 and this is the first year I added on an extra week to be able to explore these places.\nMentioned in this post &#xe041 &#xe002 Palace of Versailles 20,774 Reviews Versailles, France &#xe002 The Hall of Mirrors 2,361 Reviews Versailles, France &#xe002 The Alhambra 33,049 Reviews Granada, Spain &#xe000 Hotel Leon Bianco 934 Reviews San Gimignano, Italy &#xe002 Piazza della Cisterna 1,298 Reviews San Gimignano, Italy &#xe01a Versailles Yvelines, France &#xe01a Paris Ile-de-France, France &#xe01a Granada Province of Granada, Spain &#xe01a Fontainebleau Seine-et-Marne, France &#xe01a Italy Europe &#xe01a Tuscany Italy &#xe01a San Gimignano Province of Siena, Italy &#xe01a Cinque Terre Italian Riviera, Italy &#xe01a Leiden South Holland Province, The Netherlands &#xe03b",

      "text": "Fascinating secrets behind Akbar's zero milestone in Fatehpur Sikri The Hiran Minar is also an akashdiya — a lighthouse. 14058 --- Total Shares \nOne of the iconic images associated with Fatehpur Sikri is the Hiran Minar, which, in popular legend, is a tower embedded with elephant tusks. \nAccording to one version, Akbar would sit atop the minar, watching from this vantage the elephant fights that took place below. According to another version, the emperor would watch polo matches being played at the Chaughangah (polo ground) stretching besides a lake. \nAt the present moment, this tower stands forlorn between the Hathipol (the Elephant Gate) and the dry bed of the lake, which had now turned into fields. \nTo understand this tower and its purpose, one would have to understand the layout of the city and its inspirations, the sources of urban design. \nMughal encampment \nOne of the major sources of Mughal urban design was the mobile encampment that has not only been recorded by Akbar's historian Abu’l Fazl but also been described in a number of European travellers' accounts. The Mughals, and the Timurids before them, were peripatetic by nature: they would constantly be on the move and seldom stay for long at a spot. \nFor instance, Amir Timur, who created the magnificent palaces at Samarkand, whenever in the city, would never stay in the monuments he created, but live mostly in tents laid out in the gardens outside the city. At other times, he would be travelling with his entourage from one corner of his empire to another. The same practice was followed by Babur and his successors in India. \nThe camp on the move was no small entourage but a whole city on the march: the emperor carried with him his nobles, bureaucrats and retainers. Each had their own men at service. Then there were those who came to meet the king or the nobles. All of the travellers had their daily needs: the tanner, the barber, the grain seller, the cloth merchant, the pan seller, the physician, the veterinarian, the fodder seller — the list was unending, resulting in great multitudes of people moving along with the emperor. \nSome would be on foot, some on camels, others on horses. Some would move faster with the emperor, others would lag behind. And all had to be settled in the evening for the night. Each was assigned a place as per his status or rank. Each knew his place where to go when the emperor would stop for the night: the first tent enclosure was for the emperor. It would have two sections, the first a public space for him to give audience and another where he would himself stay. \nSomewhere around would be tents for private meetings and war councils. Beyond his enclosure would be a large cordoned-off area for the women. Tents of princes would surround them. Then, all around would be a cordon of camps of high commanders, superintendents and other high bureaucrats. Beyond this layer would be the military commanders, security guards and Army men. Petty nobles would fix their tents in the next zone, followed by the tents of other followers and retainers. \nThe farthest would be the service classes. The merchants, along with their merchandise, would occupy all the corners so that every one could approach them easily. And this arrangement would remain till the emperor would decide to commence his journey again. Similar settings would then be there at the next site of camp. \nAkashdiya \nTo guide everyone to his rightful place and to ensure that the latecomers reached the camping site even after dark and then to know where they had to go to pitch their tent, a large bamboo pole with fire lit on its top would be fixed in front of the tents of imperial authority. \nThe fire lit on the top of the pole would be the beacon which showed them where the tent of the emperor was! This was known as the akash (sky) diya (lamp), virtually a lighthouse. \nThe akashdiya would guide the night traveller to the camp, as well as mark the exact location of the sovereign: the petitioners would know where they had to go! \nThe kos minars \nStructures marking distances have been constructed in India since the ancient times. Greek ambassador Megasthenes, who travelled to India, mentions in his account that in the Mauryan period, there were milestones on roads to record distances, erected at regular predetermined spots. However, no reference to the structures of this nature is known from the Sultanate period. \nBabur, in 1528, ordered one of his Central Asian nobles, a certain Chiqmaq Beg, to measure the road between his new capital Agra and Kabul, with the assistance of the royal clerk. The emperor ordered that at every ninth kos, the noble should erect a 12-qaris (24ft or 36ft) high tower, topped with a superstructure having four openings. \nThese were the kos minars. As recorded upon surveys of some sets of these minars near Delhi, one kos measures about 4.17 kilometres. \nThis tradition was later followed by emperor Sher Shah Sur, who ordered such milestones to be built along the network of roads he laid out. Along these kos minars were his sarais and dak chaukis. This tradition was carried forward during the next reign. Akbar, it is recorded, built kos minars along the road from Agra to Ajmer. \nLater, in 1619, Jahangir ordered Baqir Khan, the faujdar of Multan, to erect kos minars from Agra to Lahore. A large number of these milestones are extant to date; most notably, 34 of these, in varying states of preservation, can be found in Punjab. \nAlthough the surviving kos minars broadly follow the same design, some of them have graceful proportions whereas the others are somewhat clumsy. \nA number of them have wedge-shaped stones studded on them: today, a few minars just bear the hole where these stones were fixed. They never had any transcription on their body. \nThe Hiran Minar of Fatehpur Sikri is an akashdiya as well as the city's zero milestone. \nIt stands (as an akashdiya) just in front of the main entrance of the fort. A miniature from the manuscript of the Akbarnama preserved at Victoria and Albert Museum (“Akbar’s victorious return to Fatehpur Sikri”, outline by Kesav the Elder, painting Nar Singh, opaque watercolour and gold on paper, Mughal, ca. 1590-95, IS.2:110-1896) testifies that this indeed was the entrance gate to the palace beyond which the Hiran Minar can be seen! \nA one-kos road leads to it when one enters through the Bharatpur gate of the city. And then from the minar to just outside the Ajmeri Gate is another kos where stands the next milestone. The horn-shaped stones have long since disappeared and only the holes where they were once fixed remain. \nJahangir had given general orders to fix deer-like horns on the kos minars erected on his road from Delhi to Lahore: he was possibly only duplicating what he had seen as a child in his father’s zero-milestone, which stood at the gate of the palace and near the grand polo grounds on the banks of the lake! \nIf one tries to draw a circle with the Hiran Minar as the centre, the whole town with its lake fits into it. \nThe minar was not only the focal point around which the town was planned but also an architectural feature that marked the “face” of Akbar's capital! #Mughals , #Akbar , #Hiran Minar , #Fatehpur Sikri The views and opinions expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of DailyO.in or the India Today Group.

      "text": "General | By Manisha Sen India Inc’s average salary hike pegged at 9.6% in FY19: KPMG report \nNew Delhi: Employees in India are expected to get an average salary hike of 9.6 per cent this financial year, while key talent are likely to get as much as 14.7 per cent, says a report. Representative Image \n“Salary hikes for financial year 2018-19 are expected to be in single digits at an industry average of 9.6 per cent, based on data from over 270 organisations across 18 sectors who participated in our Annual Compensation Trends Survey 2018-19,” said Vishalli Dongri, Partner & Head, People & Change Advisory Services, KPMG in India. \nIn financial year 2017-18, the average projected increment for the year 2017-18, was 9.7 per cent, while the actual hike stood at 9.4 per cent. \nThe report further noted that as many as 19.9 per cent of participants saw attractive benefit offerings as one of the top three levers for drawing talent. \nMoreover, almost 75 per cent of organisations identify high potential employees and may offer them an average hike of 14.7 per cent, the report noted. \n“Organisations across sectors have stated that one of their top HR priorities for this year is re-looking at their performance management system framework to create a sharper focus on a pay differentiation for high performers,” Dongri said. \nThe average variable pay projection has increased from 15.4 per cent in 2017-18 to 15.7 per cent in 2018-19, indicating that organisations are continuing to move towards paying for performance. \nThe highest variable pay as a per cent of CTC is reported by the financial services sector and the lowest by NGO sector. \nThe report offers insights into a variety of compensation trends and offers readers an important reference point on diverse aspects such as increments, benefits, employee attrition and how they are shaping up HR trends for 2018. \nPTI",

      "text": "| Source: Moneycontrol.com Few SEZ projects likely to be completed before sunset clause deadline of 2020 In NCR, only 6.0 million sq ft of SEZ space is likely to see completion. Bengaluru is expected to add only about 9.7 million sq ft of SEZ space \nThere is over 40 million sq ft of new Special Economic Zones (SEZs) supply scheduled for completion before the mandatory deadline of 2020 to qualify for income tax benefits in SEZs but it is unlikely that all the projects will be completed by then, says Colliers Research. \nOut of approximately 9.0 million sq ft planned in NCR, only 6.0 million sq ft of SEZ space in NCR likely to see completion by 2020. Bengaluru is likely to add only about 9.7 million sq ft of SEZ space by 2020, says the report. \nBengaluru, the technology capital, accounts for a maximum share of multi-tenanted SEZ stock at 39 percent followed by Hyderabad and National Capital Region (NCR) each on 14 percent, Chennai (13 percent), Pune (12 percent), Mumbai (5 percent) and Kolkata (3 percent). Moreover, a few Tier II cities such as Coimbatore, Jaipur, Kochi, Chandigarh and Visakhapatnam have a few operational SEZs. Most of the multi-tenanted SEZs have a low vacancy level ranging from 4 to 10 per that indicates the popularity of these SEZs among occupiers. \n“It is unlikely that all the projects will be completed by the deadline of 2020 which is currently mandatory for the units to qualify for income tax exemption. In such a scenario, the big question is: if the government does not extend the sunset clause, what will be the fate of the SEZs that cannot complete construction by then? related news Maharashtra to have separate office for cooperative housing societies \n“We recommend the government to make the SEZs policy more consistent to create an environment conducive to investment. It is of great interest to India to promote the export-oriented IT and manufacturing sector through SEZs, if it is aiming to achieve the objective of 'Make in India' at a faster pace,” says Colliers Research. \nIndia has more than 60 multi-tenanted SEZs across all major cities with a cumulative operational stock of about 143.0 million sq ft. SEZs represent about 25 percent of the total multi-tenanted Grade A office stock in India. SEZs are duty-free enclaves, designed to enhance economic and industrial development across various sectors such as technology, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and agriculture. These zones are geographically demarcated regions deemed to be foreign territory for trade operations, duties and tariffs. Over the last few years, SEZ developments in India have gained popularity especially among the technology sector occupiers, but also among traditional sectors such as electronics, gems and jewellery. \nIn addition, several technology companies such as HCL, Microsoft, Infosys, Hexaware and Wipro also have their own SEZ campuses which are primarily used for their in-house operations. \nOnly 6.0 million sq ft of SEZ space in NCR likely to see completion by 2020 \nIn the National Capital Region, SEZs are only located in satellite cities, namely Gurugram (Gurgaon) and Noida. At present, the consolidated operational stock of about 20.1 million sq ft is distributed across 12 SEZs in both these cities. Gurugram dominates the market with 72 percent of the NCR's SEZ stock. \nThe NCR has witnessed stable demand for SEZ office spaces over the past three years with 1.35 million sq ft of annual absorption. “Enquiries for SEZ spaces have increased over the past year. Notably, many of the top-notch SEZ developers have their eyes set on the NCR market. Ascendas and Ireo are coming up with new developments in Gurugram while developers such as Brookfield and DLF are adding new towers in their existing projects,” says Colliers Research. \nThe NCR has approximately 9.0 million sq ft of new supply planned to be developed over the next five years. More than 70 percent of the upcoming supply is concentrated in Gurugram in micro-markets such as Golf Course Extension Road and Sohna Road. Noida accounts for only 30 percent of the upcoming supply, which is concentrated at Noida Expressway. \nAccording to Colliers estimates, only 6.0 million sq ft is likely to see completion by 2020. \nMumbai to see an addition of 1.8 million sq ft of new SEZ supply by 2019 \nMumbai is a relatively passive SEZ market with only two operational IT SEZs in the city. The total SEZ stock in Mumbai is about 7.3 million sq ft and these operational SEZs are located in the Powai and Airoli micro-markets. The city is likely to see an addition of 1.8 million sq ft of new supply in Airoli by 2019, most of which is likely to be taken up by existing occupiers. Developers offering built-to-suit options in SEZs in Kolkata In their SEZ land located at Rajarhat, Kolkata, the only major city in the eastern part of the country, has observed a slow SEZ space leasing trend over the years primarily due to the state government's apprehension about developing SEZs. Overall, the city has five functional SEZs, of which only two are multi-tenanted.\nMost of the SEZs are located in Rajarhat in Kolkata. The total SEZ stock in Kolkata is about 4.0 million sq ft and an additional supply of 2.7 million sq ft in under construction. A few developers are also offering built-to-suit options in their SEZ land located at Rajarhat. The market trend also reveals that domestic technology companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro are interested in making their own captive campuses. \nBengaluru likely to add about 9.7 million sq ft of SEZ space by 2020 \nBengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India, accounts for the highest share (about 39%) of the total IT SEZ space in India. Most of the SEZs are strategically located in preferred IT destinations such as Outer Ring Road (ORR) and Whitefield accounted for 71 percent and 16 percent share respectively of the total SEZ stock in Bengaluru, while a few can also be spotted at North Bengaluru and Mysore Road. \nAlthough SEZs have accounted for about 38 percent of the total office space absorption in Bengaluru over the last three years, there was a minimal inflow of new entrants in SEZs in 2017. The demand was primarily driven by occupiers looking to relocate or expand their existing operations in SEZs. \nThe city is likely to add about 9.7 million sq ft of SEZ space by 2020. In addition, approximately 9.0 million sq ft is in the planning stage. The new supply is concentrated in existing SEZs in ORR, Whitefield and North Bengaluru. Most of the new supply will be taken up by the existing occupiers looking for expansion as 3.6 million sq ft is already pre-committed, says the report. \nDevelopers quoting similar rents for both SEZ and non-SEZ spaces in Hyderabad Hyderabad has operational multi-tenanted SEZ stock of about 20.0 million sq ft primarily located at Secondary Business District (SBD) with a small presence of SEZs in Peripheral Business District (PBD) micromarkets as well. While in 2016 SEZs contributed a share of about 49 per cent in overall new office leasing in the city, the percentage dropped to about 22 per cent of total leasing in 2017. This was primarily due to the very low vacancy rate of 3 per cent in the SBD micromarket. Developers have been quoting similar rents for both SEZ and non- SEZ spaces in the SBD.",

It is of great interest to India to promote the export-oriented IT and manufacturing sector through SEZs, if it is aiming to achieve the objective of 'Make in India' at a faster pace,” says Colliers Research. \nIndia has more than 60 multi-tenanted SEZs across all major cities with a cumulative operational stock of about 143.0 million sq ft. SEZs represent about 25 percent of the total multi-tenanted Grade A office stock in India. SEZs are duty-free enclaves, designed to enhance economic and industrial development across various sectors such as technology, manufacturing, pharmaceutical and agriculture. These zones are geographically demarcated regions deemed to be foreign territory for trade operations, duties and tariffs. Over the last few years, SEZ developments in India have gained popularity especially among the technology sector occupiers, but also among traditional sectors such as electronics, gems and jewellery. \nIn addition, several technology companies such as HCL, Microsoft, Infosys, Hexaware and Wipro also have their own SEZ campuses which are primarily used for their in-house operations. \nOnly 6.0 million sq ft of SEZ space in NCR likely to see completion by 2020 \nIn the National Capital Region, SEZs are only located in satellite cities, namely Gurugram (Gurgaon) and Noida. At present, the consolidated operational stock of about 20.1 million sq ft is distributed across 12 SEZs in both these cities. Gurugram dominates the market with 72 percent of the NCR's SEZ stock. \nThe NCR has witnessed stable demand for SEZ office spaces over the past three years with 1.35 million sq ft of annual absorption. “Enquiries for SEZ spaces have increased over the past year. Notably, many of the top-notch SEZ developers have their eyes set on the NCR market. Ascendas and Ireo are coming up with new developments in Gurugram while developers such as Brookfield and DLF are adding new towers in their existing projects,” says Colliers Research. \nThe NCR has approximately 9.0 million sq ft of new supply planned to be developed over the next five years. More than 70 percent of the upcoming supply is concentrated in Gurugram in micro-markets such as Golf Course Extension Road and Sohna Road. Noida accounts for only 30 percent of the upcoming supply, which is concentrated at Noida Expressway. \nAccording to Colliers estimates, only 6.0 million sq ft is likely to see completion by 2020. \nMumbai to see an addition of 1.8 million sq ft of new SEZ supply by 2019 \nMumbai is a relatively passive SEZ market with only two operational IT SEZs in the city. The total SEZ stock in Mumbai is about 7.3 million sq ft and these operational SEZs are located in the Powai and Airoli micro-markets. The city is likely to see an addition of 1.8 million sq ft of new supply in Airoli by 2019, most of which is likely to be taken up by existing occupiers. Developers offering built-to-suit options in SEZs in Kolkata In their SEZ land located at Rajarhat, Kolkata, the only major city in the eastern part of the country, has observed a slow SEZ space leasing trend over the years primarily due to the state government's apprehension about developing SEZs. Overall, the city has five functional SEZs, of which only two are multi-tenanted.\nMost of the SEZs are located in Rajarhat in Kolkata. The total SEZ stock in Kolkata is about 4.0 million sq ft and an additional supply of 2.7 million sq ft in under construction. A few developers are also offering built-to-suit options in their SEZ land located at Rajarhat. The market trend also reveals that domestic technology companies like TCS, Infosys, and Wipro are interested in making their own captive campuses. \nBengaluru likely to add about 9.7 million sq ft of SEZ space by 2020 \nBengaluru, the Silicon Valley of India, accounts for the highest share (about 39%) of the total IT SEZ space in India. Most of the SEZs are strategically located in preferred IT destinations such as Outer Ring Road (ORR) and Whitefield accounted for 71 percent and 16 percent share respectively of the total SEZ stock in Bengaluru, while a few can also be spotted at North Bengaluru and Mysore Road. \nAlthough SEZs have accounted for about 38 percent of the total office space absorption in Bengaluru over the last three years, there was a minimal inflow of new entrants in SEZs in 2017. The demand was primarily driven by occupiers looking to relocate or expand their existing operations in SEZs. \nThe city is likely to add about 9.7 million sq ft of SEZ space by 2020. In addition, approximately 9.0 million sq ft is in the planning stage. The new supply is concentrated in existing SEZs in ORR, Whitefield and North Bengaluru. Most of the new supply will be taken up by the existing occupiers looking for expansion as 3.6 million sq ft is already pre-committed, says the report. \nDevelopers quoting similar rents for both SEZ and non-SEZ spaces in Hyderabad Hyderabad has operational multi-tenanted SEZ stock of about 20.0 million sq ft primarily located at Secondary Business District (SBD) with a small presence of SEZs in Peripheral Business District (PBD) micromarkets as well. While in 2016 SEZs contributed a share of about 49 per cent in overall new office leasing in the city, the percentage dropped to about 22 per cent of total leasing in 2017. This was primarily due to the very low vacancy rate of 3 per cent in the SBD micromarket. Developers have been quoting similar rents for both SEZ and non- SEZ spaces in the SBD.",

      "text": "#TAL'18 The top 3 Talent Acquisition trends for 2018 Which trends are going to influence talent acquisition? Social Media, direct recruitment or internal referrals- which of these has become the most popular? Read on to find out. \nThe recruiting trends of 2017 were mostly centered on technology and automation, followed by workplace diversity with special emphasis on candidate experience. Other major themes included cross-functional collaboration and employee advocacy. Majority of talent acquisition leaders are trying to keep pace with such technological innovations and marketplace challenges. \nWith rising new roles, the conundrum of fetching the right set of new-aged skilled resources remains a daunting task. While these ideologies and concepts aren’t new, they continue to evolve and will remain hot topics in the years to come. \nLet’s take a closer look at three of the major trends that are believed to top the charts in talent acquisition across India during 2018. Increase in hiring budget and upsurge in the volume of recruitment \nMany organizations are raising their hiring budgets this year. According to a report by Mettl, an assessment and skill-measurement company, 87.6% of organizations will have an increased hiring budget in 2018 which is up from last year’s 67.8%. This survey was based on the feedback taken from around 1,860 business heads and HR leaders across the country. \nThe survey further revealed that about 76% of organizations expect to have an increased recruitment volume this year, compared to about 65% last year. In another report by Michael Page, a recruitment firm, it states that there will be an upsurge in the hiring activities in India. This can mainly be attributed to the Government’s Make in India initiative with its sharpened focus on public infrastructure projects and an upward trend in talent acquisition across many sectors. \nRecruiting by more overseas companies to build their teams in India with enhanced activity in the renewable energy sector and increasing role of technology interwoven in it will also provide a push to hiring volumes. \nIt also predicts that the top industries hiring this year will be chemicals, paints, engineering, FMCG, and retail, with average salary jump of 23% to as high as 45% while moving jobs. Proliferation of technology-based tools \nWith more HR tools and Artificial Intelligence (AI) arriving in 2018, the hiring tech market will grow and proliferate further. According to a recent LinkedIn survey report, 35% of talent professionals and hiring managers say that AI is the top trend impacting how they hire. And 56% of them say that new interview tools top the chart impacting hiring methods. The focus on automated recruitment tools for efficient candidate screening and assessment will continue to rise. \nArtificial intelligence backed by machine-learning algorithms will dominate the way recruiters screen resumes and communicate with candidates. Virtual Reality is set to bring in a lot of transformation in the arena of candidate screening and branding. All these technological upgraded tools have begun to take a strong foothold in recruiting space and will continue to trend in the coming years. Social Media Recruiting dominates the source of tapping talent \nAs per the survey done by Mettl, Social Media recruitment tops the charts as one of the most important sources of talent hunt. It clearly ranks number one with 36.17% followed by external recruitment sources contributing 23.8%, which consists of jobs fairs, campus hires, etc. Talent sourcing firms are used by 18.6% and internal references by 13.3%, while promoting talent from within or talent pipelining has slipped to 9%. With over 530 million members, LinkedIn offers a lot more than a professional network site and allows employers to shortlist and attract relevant profiles. Instagram also offers opportunities for employer branding to pull talent. Moreover, in order to tap Gen Z candidates, Social Media is the only best possible option for the employers. \nWhile the job market looks promising in most of the industry segments and with the Government’s push to revive it further, technology will play an unparalleled role in the way experienced and new-aged candidates will be hired by companies of all sizes in 2018. With the integration of Artificial Intelligence and introduction of robotics in recruitment, it will be worth a wait to watch if a robot is hiring you, or you are hiring a robot in the years to come. \nKnow more about such trends at the People Matters Talent Acquisition League Annual Conference 2018 on 30th May which will seek to address the most poignant talent acquisition challenges, what’s next in TA, and how AI and machines are becoming matchmakers for recruiters today.",

      "text": "4. Arrange each object and their functionalities based on their importance (rank from high to low). Let us find out how OOUX is important. \nFor that, we would have to travel back in time and think from the perspective of our back-end developers. It all started way back in the 80’s when the software-related community began migrating toward object-oriented languages from procedural ones. The reason for this transition was the numerous benefits provided by object-oriented language, which includes code reuse, data encapsulation and software maintenance with ease. Now we are familiar with the advantages as we have been using these object-oriented programming languages (C#, C++, Python, Ruby or Java) for designing our dreams. also Read \nTop programming languages How the process works? \nThe developers start with their process by mapping. They map the objects that comprise the problem realm (nothing new to UX designers as this is the approach that they follow from the scratch). They construe your objects by reverse engineering the design firstly; this happens after analysing the wireframes or prototypes. Thinking in terms of each object communicate with another object. Will one object be able to create many other similar objects? The parameters that needs to be incorporated into each of these objects – also analysing whether this class of objects can inherit from the associated class of objects. \nBut, when it comes to web designs, it differs; in that, though we think on the object-oriented front, the design process is procedure oriented as it starts from the drill-down pyramid or takes a linear task flow approach. Of course, there is yet another option too. Experts argue that we can still place both the front-end and back-end designs to follow the object-oriented approach, which installs a consistency throughout the software development. \nObject orientedness opens up to unveil structural connection among the objects of design, implementation and analysis. This definition of the objects will provide a demonstration of the user’s mental model framework that would further help in ensuring that there is an efficient communication in the team. This shared form of language not only provides a consistency within the team, but also provide: Improvization of user experience through mental model synchronization Minimizing unexpected complexities and imbibing in simplicity Enhance, update and maintain your products – as the objects can be iterated without affecting any other existing system functionalities Using portable and independent objects, provision to build enhanced APIs Nested linking and well-strategized content will earn you greater SEO rankings also Read \nSEO Trends \n\nOOUX is well-known for the contextual navigation, which is most important in any design and something that adds on extra points for UX. This is the only way users can efficiently move across content. \nNavigation that is forceful should be hid, kept out of sight when a user is using a screen with smaller resolution. The case is not different when you have a larger screen resolution and the navigation is beautifully pinned on top; it is not necessary that the navigation becomes any less persistent here. \nWe always think that the navigation will help our users find us with ease, but most of the times, it could be a second option when the users find no other way to explore through your site. Content on your page is the first attraction, navigation always comes after this. \nOn the basis of the kind of product or service offering, you must learn to map user intentions and movements. When they are on your site, how would they think, what would they do next or where would they like to go and what would they expect to see. All these are among a few of those questions that need to be answered when you start on the navigation part. Leaving them with a very few options will lead them to nowhere as well as us. They want you to provide them with all the options that you have got and that exists always. \nFrom the OOUX perspective, it is important to think of all the ways that can be used to connect one object to another – think beyond the impossible. There are always ample of options – it is upto you to decide whether you wish to explore these. With the little options that you have in hand, you can actually build castles. Think innovatively. It’s the context that matters – linking your content with navigation appropriately will obviously have its impact. also Read \nUX comes before UI: An Overview \nThis is where content modelling comes in and almost all of us are familiar with this concept. The information architects and content strategists have been asking to focus on how to reuse content for good, while getting involved in-depth across the CMS design process – here not only the end-user but even the content developer becomes an user – so, it is important to consider all these factors when designing. This is how experts persuade the concept of content development before even the wireframes or prototypes of the interaction design are developed. \nMoreover, this gives an insight into systematic knowledge – wherein you will know what kind of content needs to be included and also explore all the various options along with other elements that would work in the interaction flow. But, many of us still refrain from utilizing the concept of content modelling. UX designers should start perceiving content as an important factor too. Though, the UX designers who are working on software-as-a-service have started experimenting with content these days. How do we connect content modelling and objects? \nNow, it is clear that object mapping is the process involved in OOUX. Though, the designers never need to directly deal with content, still the content would be involved in the design process; unlike their implementation as a system for the sake of content. Of course, the implementation of templates and modules that can be reused is priceless, these become useless unless they match the user’s real-time mental model. So, it is important that you should be designing real-world objects and then strategize a system that will blow life across these. Your objects would abstract goals and these goals will execute a system for users – offering one of the best UX. also Read \nUX designer tips for landing page How do we map system goals onto the objects? Here are a few tips for the same: 1.As you have a clear idea of your object and goals, it makes it easier for you to abstract your object from goals. \nDo your research well. The results of your research are going to serve as the foundation for your abstraction. The user research results will provide you with the goals that your uses expect to accomplish via the process. Once the goals are ready, highlight the actions within it and then abstract your objects from these actions, which can be tricky of course, but a lot easier. 2.Content also comes first, so before we proceed let us define content. \nOnce we abstract the objects, the next step is to add the content descriptions to each of these objects. The detailed content comprises the main information along with the metadata that would help in sorting the objects further. 3.Let us do some match making by connecting and linking objects. \nNow that the objects have got their core content defined, these have come into action. The next step is to find out the relationship between these objects to understand further how each object is connected with one another and how this connection will help you further. 4. Arrange each object and their functionalities based on their importance (rank from high to low). \nThis would further help with the filtering of these objects. UX people are aware of this kind of an approach, but this will further help in glorifying the process in the long run. The entire process can be collectively represented as a framework. This framework you can use while presenting the process flow to your stakeholders, clients or team. \nWe are slowly implementing this into our work flow. \nAre you looking for an excellent web design process for your business? \nAcodez is a web design company offering all kinds of web development company in India and abroad.

These self-proclaimed liberals who have an opinion on anything and everything, without any radical knowledge or experience on the subject cause a social tumult over just every passing trend. \nRead more: Remember IAS Topper Tina Dabi Who Was Trolled For Dating A Muslim Guy? She Just Married Him \nTake this case into consideration for instance. 2015 IAS topper Tina Dabi recently married the guy who lost the first position to her. The 24-year-old IAS officer who topped the coveted civil services exam tied the knot with 25-year-old Athar Aamir-ul-Shafi Khan in south Kashmir's Pahalgam on Saturday. I’d like to talk to you about our wedding.Athar and I got married on 20th Marchby in Jaipur by Collector Shri Siddharth Mahajan. Then we planned two wedding celebrations. The Kashmir celebration happened recently. The Delhi wedding celebration will be held on 14th April. pic.twitter.com/IlLk3pSwVi — Tina Dabi (@dabi_tina) April 9, 2018 \nFrom Shashi Tharoor to Barkha Dutt, everyone took it to social media to congratulate the couple who are an inspiration to the country's youth on many levels. Unfortunately, the youth didn't have many great things to say. 1. Warm congratulations to @dabi_tina & @AtharAamirKhan , first and second rank holders in IAS2015, whose achievements are inspirational for thousands of young Indians, on setting another example through their marriage. Wishing them happiness, peace & enduring love& understanding. — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) April 9, 2018 2.

Tina Dabi is a Achhoot Dalit for uper cast Hindus and she follows Buddhism. But soon after she marries to a Muslim.... pic.twitter.com/03gMi1cl6w — Honest Liar™ (@Hones8Liar) April 10, 2018 2.

      "text": " 10 (ANI): Computer technology MNC Oracle noted that Indian developers are increasingly inclined to open, container native technologies for rapid application development and deployment.\nThe company's latest study noted that as developers understand the need to move fast, build for the cloud, but retain the flexibility to run where the business or workloads require, there is more leaning towards open source based, community driven technology stack to avoid cloud lock-in.\nWith 2018 touted to be a defining year for modern cloud developers, Oracle is hosting its global, flagship ' Oracle Code ' developer focused event series in India yet again. Oracle Code enables developers to get a deep, hands-on view into emerging technologies and techniques for modern cloud development.\nA number of trends have surfaced in the recent past, as per Oracle .\nAs per IDC, a research firm, 90 percent consumers will interact with chatbots by 2025. Embedding AI into apps with chatbots is a key priority for the developer community across the globe. Not only are chatbots a tool that business partners will value, but form the building blocks for machine learning systems that use natural language conversations, image analytics, augmented reality, and enterprise data.\nAnother trend popular in 2017 was that of serverless computing. It provides fantastic benefits to developers as they focus on the functionality of their code. Additionally, it is elastic, executes complex transactions and provides maximum portability\nHowever, Java remains the top choice for companies capable of handling traditional and new styles of programming. This implies that as enterprises inevitably migrate more workload to the cloud, Java is a great foundation for serverless skills.\nWith the potential to revolutionise, both containers and micro servers have become highly popular. Developers can push a new crop of cloud-native apps using micro services and containers.\nBlockchain has also opened up several new growth avenues, especially in industries that were more prone to fraud. Developers are creating innovative solutions in finance, logistics, and other verticals by leveraging permissioned blockchain technology.\n\"In the cloud economy, businesses are always searching for innovative ways to increase their developer velocity and agility, to accelerate digital transformation. Developers are increasingly preferring open, cloud-neutral, and community-driven container-native software stacks that enable them to avoid cloud lock-in and to run in a true hybrid mode - so they can use the same stack in the cloud - for that matter on any cloud - as they run on-premises,\" said Ravi Pinto, Director - Product Management, Oracle Cloud Platform.

Home » Beauty » Haircare » Gryffindor And Butterbeer Harry Potter Hair Colors Are Big This Year!   \nHarry Potter has inspired a lot of beauty trends, starting from lip art to eyeshadow palettes. The new toast of the season is the recreation of Harry Potter-inspired hair color, and it’s the most awesome thing. The hair color is nothing short of mystical, as it combines a bit of Gryffindor’s red and yellow colors, with hints of green, blue, and purple, creating a mesmerizing optical illusion from within. The look was created by Virginia Beach-based colorist, Crystal Casey, and first spotted on Instagram by Allure. To achieve the Harry Potter inspired color combo, you need to start bleaching parallel strips into your hair. After that, make use of balayage and color-melting tricks to achieve a vibrant and prismatic pattern. Start with Proper Hair Treatment: \nIf you are interested in trying the Harry Potter look for yourself, then it is important to follow the proper kind of care and upkeep. And you should avoid using shampoos with harsh sulfates. Instead, make use of a color-safe and parabens-free shampoo and conditioner. For long lasting hair color, always wash with cold water, because this type of hair color can require high-maintenance, depending on how you wish to care for your hair. Gryffindor’s Harry Potter Themed Hair \nThe Gryffindor-inspired hair dye was first discovered by a Virginia-based hairstylist, Crystal Casey’s Instagram called Allure. Originally, Casey had posted the experimental hair color earlier in March, after which, she released the lengthy process it look with a step-by-step tutorial. Casey stated, “The color itself was inspired by Gryffindor from the Harry Potter movies, with my own twist, of course.” The striking color is the resultant of mixing basic balayage with a color melting technique, which results into a checkered like gradient. Step-by-step tutorial to achieve Gryffindor’s Hair: \nCasey stated, “The color itself was inspired by Gryffindor from the Harry Potter movies, with my own twist of course.” Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how Casey creates the look: Bleach horizontal lines onto the hair to serve as the base of your color creation. Then make use of a basic balayage and color melting technique to create dimension to your hair color for the harry potter balayage hair. While the overall results appear fully horizontal, Casey actually added color vertically and diagonally to add depth to the hair strands. A post shared by Virginia Beach Hairstylist (@cryistalchaos) on Mar 24, 2018 at 6:02pm PDT Which look should you choose? \nA lot of the natural brown base is left untouched whilst trying the Gryffindor’s hair so women with any skin tone can wear it. It comes down to how experimental you’re feeling, because like Casey says, “While this color is definitely not conservative, the bold placement can work for a 9-5 depending on the way you style it.” Or if you are not comfortable with drastic transformations, then try a more muted version of this hair color. But be sure to show your hair colorist an image of the original hair color, so they have a better idea on how to tone down the hair color as requested by you. Butterbeer Harry Potter Inspired Hair Color \nAnother hot trend to watch out for, is the rainbow hair, which involves dyeing your hair strands in the warm tones of butterbeer. This is a blonde-meet-butterscotch ombre hair named after Harry, Ron, and Hermoine’s favorite Hogsmeade beverage. Harry Potter fans may be familiar with the drink, but if you are not a Harry Potter fan, then let us explain how it relates. Source: instagram.com/presleypoe/ \nButterbeer is a wizard beverage that supposedly tastes like butterscotch and contains small content of alcohol. \nThe sweet and foamy beverage enjoyed by the wizards tastes a lot like butterscotch. This is how the new hair color trend is now being adopted, inspired by Butterbeer. This combo is about mimicking the colors of Butterbeer and the tasty foam that comes around the top. Hence the name: Butterbeer hair. \nSimilar to the Gryffindor’s hair, the Butterbeer hair too requires upkeep and extra care. Source: twitter \nButterbeer hair is a shade of caramel with bright yellow and orange tones or highlights. The hair color trend consists of muted shades, neon colors, and other colors in between. \nOne of the most gorgeous versions of Butterbeer hair comes courtesy of Columbian, Missouri-based colorist Chris Mears. His Instagram feed is packed with several unique hair colors, like green, blue, and purple. A quick look at his Instagram feed suggests that he is an artist who loves creating bold looks. \nThere are several takes on the look, but most Potter fans are rocking a dark butterscotch base that fades to a yellow tip. Here are few of the Butterbeer harry potter inspired hair: Source: instagram.com/totallymeta/ \nNot only is this hair color replicating the Butterbeer trend, but it’s a pretty clear shot of Gryffindor. Source: instagram.com/kristen.beehive/ \nThis is a more subtle version of the Butterbeer trend. This style is one of the more subdued amongst all other versions, but just as luminous. Source: instagram.com/jodiatthezoo/ \nThis is a more natural version of Butterbeer hair trend. It consists of champagne shades added with a bit of caramel for achieving a frothy shade. Source: instagram.com/omgartistry/ \nNo matter how subtle or drastic hair color you’re most comfortable with, Butterbeer hair is within reach for any Howard fan who desires it. \nEven if this is not a hair trend you’d agree to, we can all come clean that this is one hair color trend that we all can approve of. \nThese are all the secrets you need to know on what color is harry potter’s hair and how to get it.

      "text": "Next The Congress, the BJP and the JD(S) have begun a vicious campaign for the May 12 elections to the 224-member Karnataka Assembly. If Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has changed the political fault lines with his move to give separate religion status to the Lingayat community, the BJP aims to dent his minority-backward classes-Dalit vote bank. By RAVI SHARMA \nWITH elections to the 224-member Legislative Assembly slated for May 12, Karnataka has plunged into hectic political activity with the three main protagonists, the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Dal (Secular), resorting to vicious mudslinging against one another. \nIn an election that is yet to see a context or issue crystallise into a plank on which the parties can build their campaigns, personal attacks and innuendo are ruling the roost, with the Congress and the BJP leading the way. Given the significance of the Karnataka elections as a dress rehearsal for both the national parties for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, electioneering is turning out to be a bitter affair. The Siddaramaiah-led Congress government’s decision to give a separate religious identity and minority status (with all the trappings of reservation, especially in education, that go with it) to Lingayats, distinct from the monolithic Hindu fold and delinked from the Veerashaiva faith, has ensured that the atmosphere is a heady cocktail of godmen, religion and politics. \nThe importance of doing well in Karnataka, a State that has been consistently voting against the national trend, is not lost on anyone, especially the Congress, which is pulling out all stops in a bid to retain power. If that is to happen, Siddaramaiah will have to buck the trend, since no incumbent government has come back to power in the State since 1985. Of course, the Congress will be less concerned with the fact that the BJP won 17 of the 28 Lok Sabha seats in the State in 2014 when Narendra Modi led the party’s campaign. Senior Congressman and former Chief Minister M. Veerappa Moily stressed the need to win in the State by saying that it would be a “morale booster, the injection and fuel for the Congress to win in 2019”. \nIn the last Assembly elections, held in May 2013, the Congress won 122 seats and polled 36.59 per cent of the votes; the JD(S) won 40 seats and 20.19 per cent of the votes; and the BJP 40 seats and 19.89 per cent of the votes. The Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP) and the Badavara Shramikara Raithara Congress, two political parties formed by breakaway BJP leaders, won six (9.79 per cent of the votes) and four seats (2.89 per cent of the votes) respectively. The Congress’ increased tally over its 2008 results (when it won 80 seats and sat in the opposition) came about with a marginal 1.83 per cent increase in its vote share. This was possible because the BJP, thanks to blatant corruption, an overtly aggressive Hindutva ideology, factionalism, nepotism in the administration, official high-handedness and moral policing, was comprehensively and convincingly rejected by the voter. Its vote share declined by a whopping 13.9 percentage points from its 2008 share of 33.86 percentage points. \nThe decline was partly because of the split in the party with the KJP playing the spoiler. Even the combined BJP-KJP vote share was 4.1 percentage points lower than the BJP’s 2008 vote share and almost 7 percentage points lower than the Congress’ vote share of 36.59 per cent. The electoral defeat derailed the BJP’s grand plans to use Karnataka—which was seen as the Gujarat of the south and a possible laboratory for Hindutva policies—as its political gateway to conquering the south. \nUntil a few months ago, the political battle lines in the State, where caste more than religion has always been, and still is, the overriding factor (religious polarisation has only been effective in the coastal areas), were drawn along the time-tested fault lines. But the BJP will perhaps depend on stretching the communal fabric to its last thread by whipping up the Hindutva sentiment, project Prime Minister Modi as the party’s mascot and hope to continue reaping the votes of the politically dominant Lingayat community, which has been supporting the BJP since the 1994 elections. The JD(S), mockingly called the “father-and-sons party”, will draw support mostly from rural areas and from the Vokkaliga community, while the Congress will bank on its traditional vote bank—minorities, Dalits and backward classes—and Siddaramaiah’s own Kuruba caste, the third largest homogeneous group in Karnataka after Lingayats and Vokkaligas. Siddaramaiah, a wily politician and a relatively new entrant to the Congress, had just prior to joining the party (in 2006) spearheaded a social combination called AHINDA ( alpasankhyak , or minorities, induliga , or OBC, and Dalits), similar to the KHAM (Kshatriya, Adivasi, Muslim) alliance forged by Madhavsinh Solanki in Gujarat in the 1980s . According to Siddaramaiah, the AHINDA social engineering movement was meant to prevent youths from the backward classes and Dalit communities from joining the Hindutva brigade. During his term as Chief Minister, Siddaramaiah, besides his many effective welfare/economic programmes (termed political populism by his opponents), has been able to offer sops to each of the wheels in the AHINDA bandwagon. \nBut Siddaramaiah’s defining moment was on March 19 when he decided to accept the Justice H.N. Nagamohan Das Committee’s recommendation to grant religious minority status to Lingayats and Veerashaiva-Lingayats, those who follow some of the teachings of Basaveshwara, or Basavanna, the 12th century philosopher-social reformer, but also practise Hindu rituals, under Section 2(d) of the Karnataka State Minorities Commission Act, and forward the recommendation to the Union government, seeking notification under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992. Lingayats have a strong political, economic and social presence in the State, especially in northern Karnataka, and constitute around 14 per cent of the State’s population and are predominant in close to 100 of the 224 Assembly seats. There have been nine Chief Ministers from the community, which has traditionally supported the party that had the tallest Lingayat leader. While in the initial years it was the Congress that benefited, thanks to leaders such as Basappa Danappa Jatti, S. Nijalingappa, S.R. Bommai, S.R. Kanthi, Veerendra Patil (all former Chief Ministers of Karnataka), the unceremonious ouster of Veerendra Patil in 1989 from the Congress saw Lingayats shift their loyalty to B.S. Yeddyurappa and by extension the BJP starting from the mid 1990s, consolidating themselves into the saffron party’s bulwark while it made electoral inroads into the State. \nBoth Lingayats and Veerashaivas have for decades been classified together under the Other Backward Classes category, with the term Lingayat being used synonymously for both sects in all administrative matters. Much to the chagrin of Veerashaivas, Lingayats demanded last July that they be considered the “true followers” of Basavanna, arguing that Veerashaivas were just another Hindu Saivite sect. \nSiddaramaiah’s move recommending a separate religious tag for Lingayats has set the cat among the pigeons. The BJP has been put on the back foot with the threat of losing its biggest support base becoming a stark reality. Whether the Centre will ratify the decision or not, the move is expected to give the Congress rich electoral dividends. Although there have always been doctrinal and cultural differences between Veerashaivas and Lingayats, they have never looked so visibly divided before. \nNaturally, State BJP leaders disagree. Said K.S. Eshwarappa: “Lingayats and Veerashaivas are with the BJP. Siddaramaiah’s decision to recommend minority status to Lingayats is a non-election issue.” Senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar said: “Siddaramaiah’s decision to recommend minority status is purely electoral politics. It has been done with mala fide intentions, to divide the Lingayat and Veerashaiva communities. The decision has resulted in the pontiffs of both sects coming onto the streets and fighting. Both communities have seen this and will punish the Congress for attempting to divide them.” \nIt is a risk Siddaramaiah and the Congress run. Seers such as Veerasomeshwara Swami, seer of the Rambhapuri Peetha, one of the pancha peethas (major Veerashaiva mutts), have already spoken out against Siddaramaiah’s decision, warning the Congress government of a “holy war against those trying to divide the community”. \nNotwithstanding denials by State leaders, BJP bigwigs have scurried to counter the Chief Minister’s move. BJP president Amit Shah visited important Lingayat mutts such the Siddaganga mutt in Tumakuru, the Bekkina Kalmata mutt in Shivamogga, and the Tharalabalu mutt at Sirigere, to seek the “blessings” of the respective pontiffs. \nThe voting preference of Lingayats, if at all they vote as a block, could dictate who rules Karnataka. It is for this reason that the BJP is unable to even think of an alternative to, leave alone do away with, its most valuable asset, and also, arguably, its biggest liability—former Chief Minister and Lingayat leader, Yeddyurappa. If the BJP rode to power in Karnataka in 2008 on the veteran leader’s shoulders, it was his decision to form his own ragtag outfit, after he was allegedly involved in illegal mining and land deals and was jettisoned by the BJP, that led to the BJP’s defeat in 2013. Yeddyurappa, the Lingayat icon who returned to the BJP in 2014, is seen as indispensable if the BJP is to recapture power in Karnataka. But his presence could force the BJP to temper its allegations of the Siddaramaiah regime being corrupt. The BJP’s chief ministerial nominee after all was thrown out of the party on corruption charges. During a campaign rally, Amit Shah, in a Freudian slip, referred to the Yeddyurappa regime as corrupt. \nEven as the Centre grapples with the issue of approval of minority status to Lingayats, Siddaramaiah, a regional satrap in a national party, has stoked regional sentiments by unveiling a new flag for Karnataka. If the flag is approved by the Centre, Karnataka will be only the second State after Jammu and Kashmir to have its own flag. The flag is symbolic of Siddaramaiah’s ability to counter the BJP’s aggressive nationalism with a matching Kannadiga subnationalism, thanks to his attempt at social engineering. \nAll the three major contestants are yet to officially come out with their first list of candidates. High-level committees have been constituted to decide the candidates’ list. While the Congress is expected to announce a list of 100 candidates made up mostly of those who lost by narrow margins in 2013, the BJP, according to Eshwarappa, is zeroing in on candidates “who have a good rapport with the party cadre and the public and have the best chance of winning”. But like most leaders, he admits that caste is the overriding factor in finalising a candidate. Caste, money and muscle, in that order, still determine the success or failure of a candidate. The BJP, which has in recent years faced factionalism among its ranks, has decided that its top leaders from outside the State (in consultation with leaders such as Yeddyurappa) will have the final say. The party is hoping to pit Modi against Siddaramaiah and counter AHINDA with Hindutva. \nAlthough campaigning has started, it has, according to veteran JD(S) leader P.G.R. Sindhia, been “subjective rather than objective, focussed on personalities, with neither of the parties really discussing issues or offering alternative thinking and models of development”. Rahul Gandhi’s missives \nCongress president Rahul Gandhi, who has made five trips to Karnataka in March/April touring Hyderabad-Karnataka, Bombay-Karnataka, the coastal and Malnad regions, and southern Karnataka as part of his “Jana Ashirvada” rallies galvanising support for the re-election of the Siddaramaiah government, hopped from temple to dargah and church to religious mutt, accusing the BJP of spreading violence and hatred, neglecting the welfare of farmers, forming governments and winning elections using money, and creating conflicts and dividing the country for the sake of power. In dozens of speeches attacking Modi (who was mockingly addressed as the person with a “56-inch chest” and the “Big Boss who likes to spy on Indians), the Congress president chided Modi for the Punjab National Bank scam, faux pas in foreign policy, the Jammu and Kashmir situation, failure in job creation, being accompanied by someone (Yeddyurappa) who has spent time in jail, and helping his (Modi’s) industrial friends during the demonetisation drive. Rahul Gandhi has not spared the JD(S) either. Speaking in the old Mysuru region, where the JD(S) has a significant presence, drawing most of its strength from the dominant Vokkaliga community, the Congress president asked the party to come clean on its support to the BJP and on whether it was the “BJP’s B team or not”. \nIrked by Rahul Gandhi’s remark that JD(S) stands for “Janata Dal Sangh Parivar”, a livid H.D. Deve Gowda, the party’s chief and former Prime Minister, told Frontline that it was unbecoming of a person who wants to become the future Prime Minister of the country “to stoop so low and blindly read chits that are placed before him”. \nHe said: “I am not going to be scratching my head about what my opponents or the media are saying. The people have realised that more damage cannot be done to the JD(S). The Siddaramaiah government has been the most corrupt and nepotistic that I have seen in my 56-year political career.” \nHis son and heir apparent and State JD(S) president, H.D. Kumaraswamy, has during his “Vikas Parva” rallies across the State focussed on playing the regional card and capitalising on his rural vote base. \nHe highlighted the woes of the State’s farmers, who according to him had incurred losses of more than Rs.58,000 crore in the past four and half years. (According to the State Agriculture Department, 3,515 farmers committed suicide in Karnataka between April 2013 and November 2017, and 2,525 suicides were owing to drought and crop failure.) Accusing the two national parties of not finding a permanent solution to issues concerning agriculture, irrigation and employment, Kumaraswamy said that “if abusing each other would solve people’s problems”, he, too, would spend two hours bad-mouthing other parties and their leaders. \nHe said Siddaramaiah announced a waiver of farm loans totalling Rs.8,160 crore but did not take adequate steps to ensure that farmers received the benefits. Kumaraswamy also claimed that during his tenure as Chief Minister he had taken steps to waive loans, but the then Finance Minister, Yeddyurappa, did not agree to a waiver. \nAmit Shah has tried to counter Rahul Gandhi’s election rallies by making frequent visits to Karnataka. A number of Union Ministers have taken part in Yeddyurappa’s State-wide 75-day “Parivartan Yatra”, which was kicked off last November. The BJP has termed Siddaramaiah a(nti)-Hindu, playing on the word AHINDA. \nBut the politics of polarisation, overriding even caste equations, has not worked in the entire State, with the possible exception of the Hindutva belt—the districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi. But even here, the saffron party came a cropper in 2013 when its seat tally dropped from 10 in 2008 to two. In a bid to counter any loss from its Lingayat base, the BJP, in what is arguably its biggest Dalit outreach, has been wooing the influential Dalit mutt seer, Madhara Chennaiah Swamiji of Chitradurga. He wields spiritual and political influence over the 1.5 crore Madigas (a Dalit sect). Madigas are unhappy with Siddaramaiah because of his reluctance to accede to their demand for internal reservation in the Scheduled Caste quota. \nThe BJP is hoping to cash in on this and make a dent in Siddaramaiah’s AHINDA platform.",

      "title": "All-new Ford Focus unveiled",
      "text": "2,403 Views 0 Comments \nFord has unveiled the new fourth-generation version of Focus range – the family hatchback that redefined the company’s attitude to dynamic ability when it was launched in 1998. The American carmaker says that the car's agility, engagement and ‘fun-to-drive’ feelings remain unchanged; it has also retained driving engagement as a key priority for the new Focus. \nThe new fourth-gen Focus will be available globally in three body styles – five-door hatchback, sedan and estate. The brand has said that a raft of new technology will make the Focus the most advanced car it sells in Europe. \nThe Focus hatchback will be offered in ST-Line trim – which has a suspension 10mm lower than the standard car’s – and as an Active-badged near-crossover variant, which sits 30mm higher than standard. Ford’s upmarket Vignale specification will also be offered on the new car, in addition to the regular Titanium trim level. \nAside from otherwise consistent interior architecture, the Focus Active will feature some harder-wearing materials. The Vignale cars will receive more upmarket trims and include more satin materials and ST-Line models will be sportier. Meanwhile, regular Titanium versions will sit somewhere between these trims. \nThe latest Focus is built on a highly adaptable new Ford platform called C2, which will underpin dozens of medium-sized forthcoming models, including the next-generation Kuga SUV. By 2021, Ford expects C-segment SUV and crossover sales to outstrip those of regular models. \nInitially, petrol engines for the new Focus will be the familiar three-cylinder EcoBoost units, adapted for improved economy. The 1.0-litre triple engine has a new turbocharger and cylinder head, a higher compression ratio (now 10.5:1) and increased injection pressure (250bar). It also has a petrol particulate filter. Outputs in the range of 85hp to 126hp are expected for the European market models. \nThere will be two EcoBlue-badged four-cylinder diesels. The 1.5-litre cars come with 95hp and 120hp motors, while the 2.0-litre engine makes 150hp. \nA hot ST version will follow and although there has been no official confirmation of a high-performance RS model, our sister publication, Autocar UK, understands that there will be one mild-hybrid powertrain making 406hp and 576Nm of torque. \nAll variants will drive through a six-speed manual transmission or an eight-speed automatic. The latter is optional only on the highest-powered petrol of each size, the top-spec 1.5-litre diesel and the 2.0-litre diesel engines. It’s a conventional torque-converter auto 'box rather than a dual-clutch unit, following an industry trend towards smoother conventional auto gearboxes. \nThanks to the wheelbase extension, the Focus’ interior dimensions are said to have improved immensely, despite the only modest increase in external girth. Knee-room in the rear is up 56mm, front shoulder room is said to be class-leading and – thanks to a re-profiling of the rear doors – rear passengers’ heads are now adjacent to glass rather than metal, so they can look outside more easily. \nThe Ford Focus rivals the likes of the Hyundai i30 and Volkswagen Golf, internationally. Closer to home, Ford has recently joined hands with Mahindra in developing future models for the Indian market. Read more on that here . \nTell us what you think. SEARCH REVIEW",
