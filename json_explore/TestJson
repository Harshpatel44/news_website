The arrests were made when Odisha Pradesh Youth Congress (OPYC) President Loknath Maharathy was leading an agitation protesting frequent hike in fuel prices. Maharathy and five others were arrested for tearing a poster of Narendra Modi at a fuel outlet near Delta square locality, police said. The youth Congress activists also took out rallies on motorcycles shouting slogans against the price hike. The protesters also asked the petrol pump owners in the city to remove Modi\'s posters. "Our agitation will continue till fuel prices are reduced. If prices of petrol and diesel are not brought down, posters of Narendra Modi will be removed across the state," Maharathy said. Slamming the BJD government after the arrest of the youth leaders, Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) President, Prasad Harichandan, alleged that the police played a partisan and discriminatory role while dealing with Congress protesters. The BJP, on the other hand, accused the ruling BJD in the state of using Congress for its benefit. State BJP vice President Sameer Mohanty alleged that both BJD and Congress are working together against the Narendra Modi government. Refuting the allegation, BJD spokesperson Amar Satpathy said the BJD had organised its protest against fuel price hike earlier and there is no question of joining hands with the Congress.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T21:21:05.073+03:00', 'uuid': 'c58f1ded758f9bf52d93abe101adb7630d10331b', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T19:14:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': "6 Congress workers held for tearing PM's poster", 'site': 'eenaduindia.com', 'main_image': 'http://img.en.eenaduindia.com/Article/201804082144014906_6-Congress-workers-held-for-tearing-PMs-poster_SECVPF.gif', 'domain_rank': 15495, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': "6 Congress workers held for tearing PM's poster", 'uuid': 'c58f1ded758f9bf52d93abe101adb7630d10331b', 'site_section': 'http://www.eenaduindia.com/RSS/SectionRssFeed.aspx?Id=176&Main=1&IsState=1', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T19:14:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'IE', 'site_full': 'www.eenaduindia.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9KsJqTvyBDhcDJWmOT5SIF2VBgIT0jMosmaf3gwLuD1QahnaJU0kAiPoD1pxXuW9gmnoEvPoE9UBWxsdg.G9SGbSM3.5a40_1sNaatkzCpmuFXxi8A3kyWfnpaGZ7HSEh50qRJMkNtvv_IoE9NrIctQtBxySwT6QQ-', 'section_title': 'EenaduIndia | Odisha'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'delta', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'maharathy', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'loknath maharathy', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'congress', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'odisha pradesh youth congress', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9KsJqTvyBDhcDJWmOT5SIF2VBgIT0jMosmaf3gwLuD1QahnaJU0kAiPoD1pxXuW9gmnoEvPoE9UBWxsdg.G9SGbSM3.5a40_1sNaatkzCpmuFXxi8A3kyWfnpaGZ7HSEh50qRJMkNtvv_IoE9NrIctQtBxySwT6QQ-', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'feedback.english@eenadudigital.com (EenaduIndia)', 'external_links': [], 'title': "Modi turns down Goyal's plan to turn CST into museum: Sources", 'text': 'Modi turns down Goyal\'s plan to turn CST into museum: Sources   22:44 IST Maximum Length : 250 Pic Courtesy: Getty Images New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned down Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\'s ambitious plan to convert Mumbai\'s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus into one of the first museum-cum-railway stations in India, ministry sources said. The terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878. It was designed on the late medieval Italian models and it was elevated to the status of a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2004. Goyal had announced to convert the busy terminal into a "world-class museum" during his visit there in November. During a meeting attended by Goyal and senior Railway Board members on March 26, Prime Minister Modi questioned the logic behind such ambitious projects, the sources said. They said the Railway Board was also against Goyal\'s museum proposal, which could displace a lot of employees and it would be difficult to accommodate them somewhere else. Railway zones, too, had objected to it. The prime minister is understood to have remarked on the lack of railway artifacts that could be showcased in the proposed museum, which, the sources said, were not enough. The bids for the Rs 250-million project was invited by Railway\'s subsidiary RITES, which likely received response from top architectural conservation and building restoration firms. At least 13 companies have submitted expressions of interest to design the two floors of the terminal into a museum complex, the sources say. They indicated that the prime minister has also cast a shadow on Goyal\'s ambitious electrification plan and his efforts to modernise the train signalling system by bringing in an European model - both of which are now likely put on hold. Moreover, Goyal wanted the Railways to hire more safai karmacharis but has been asked to make do with the existing staff, the sources said. All the PMO\'s objections, they said, have now been published as minutes of the meeting and thus documented. "During the meeting, the ministry was asked to concentrate on projects that are implementable. These projects had objections from the Board, zones and even in certain cases the Finance Ministry," the sources said.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T21:21:39.000+03:00', 'uuid': '1d041c50a225c9ecf39929e06bc3581efe171e77', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T20:14:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': "Modi turns down Goyal's plan to turn CST into museum: Sources", 'site': 'eenaduindia.com', 'main_image': 'http://img.en.eenaduindia.com/Article/201804082244121680_Modi-turns-down-Goyals-plan-to-turn-CST-into-museum_SECVPF.gif', 'domain_rank': 15495, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': "Modi turns down Goyal's plan to turn CST into museum: Sources", 'uuid': '1d041c50a225c9ecf39929e06bc3581efe171e77', 'site_section': 'http://www.eenaduindia.com/RSS/SectionRssFeed.aspx?Id=13&Main=2', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T20:14:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'IE', 'site_full': 'www.eenaduindia.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9KsJqTvyBDhcDJWmOT5SIFbuz545AuaCVzViwFdGflg.2xCnyBgq8lDfUeeiHt2VfhasGwk9SM8eRyVWCHDmOEf_Sq9DFUY.uoxi09BnNuSUCkuTw5H2qnlefDCrIlOy_1MX4GOsJmoSyjlil8G3Xq', 'section_title': 'EenaduIndia | National'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'getty images new delhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'mumbai', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'india', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'goyal', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'piyush goyal', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'railway board', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9KsJqTvyBDhcDJWmOT5SIFbuz545AuaCVzViwFdGflg.2xCnyBgq8lDfUeeiHt2VfhasGwk9SM8eRyVWCHDmOEf_Sq9DFUY.uoxi09BnNuSUCkuTw5H2qnlefDCrIlOy_1MX4GOsJmoSyjlil8G3Xq', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'arunnadh', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi an “iron man” for fast-tracking development in the country : Yogi Adityanath', 'text': 'Home NEWS India Prime Minister Narendra Modi an “iron man” for fast-tracking development in the...

The former “untouchables” were protesting against what they say is the dilution of a law meant to protect them. The mass protest, which was the first of its kind, was mostly peaceful – protesters blocked roads, participated in sit-ins and chanted slogans. But government forces and other right-wing groups were there to silence this Dalit resistance cry. They opened fire on the demonstrators. At least 11 people, most of them believed to be from the Dalit community, were killed. \nThe Bharat Bandh was a turning point in India’s caste struggles. But to fully understand the significance of this mass protest – and the reasons why India’s Dalits finally decided to take to the streets – it is necessary to analyse the current Indian government’s aggressive policies and deep-seated hostile attitudes towards this underprivileged group. \nTrying to preserve the caste system \nThe Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) together constitute more than 20 percent of India’s population – approximately 250 million people. As the most underprivileged group in the country, they have long been the target of hate crimes and discrimination in India, but their situation got only worse after the Bharatiya Janatha Party (BJP) came to power. \nThe BJP is an off-shoot of the Hindu fundamentalist organisation, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The RSS’s ultimate aim is to transform India into a conservative Hindu state, in which all traditions of Hinduism, including the caste system and untouchability, are preserved. Although they do not say this openly, they are against any form of social mobility and reform in the country. \nThey work to protect the rights and privileges of the Brahmins (the priestly caste), the Banias (the business caste) and the Kshatriyas (the warrior caste). They also work aggressively to “protect” cows – the animal that is revered as sacred by Hindus. But they are mostly silent when it comes to the abuses the Shudras (the working class), the Dalits (the scheduled castes) and the Adivasis (the scheduled tribes) face in India. \nDiluting reservations \nThe Dalits are scared that the BJP and the RSS are trying to dilute the system of reservations in India – an affirmative action programme guaranteeing scheduled castes and tribes reserved places in educational institutions, government jobs and even seats in parliament and the state assemblies. These reservations or quotas are justified as a means of making up for millennia of discrimination based on birth. \nOver the years, this system helped underprivileged communities in India to get back on their feet and claim their rightful place in the Indian society. Reservations even allowed the emergence of a small Dalit middle class. But today, some members of the “upper” castes are extremely resentful about the reservations system and the success of this Dalit middle class. \nThe dilution of reservation provisions in every institution has already started. The RSS and the BJP are seemingly working to set back any progress underprivileged communities achieved through this affirmative action programme. The leader of the RSS, Mohan Bhagwat, who is a Saraswat Brahmin from Maharastra, has been consistently talking against reservations. \nNo visible Dalit has been appointed to a decision-making role in any big governmental institution in recent years. Also, Dalit students are facing a negative atmosphere in universities. The Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (The student wing of the RSS), mainly headed by casteist upper-caste youth, attacks Dalit students and questions their place in India’s universities on a regular basis. \nAll this is happening because the BJP/RSS is against social transformation in India. They want the caste system, which classifies Dalits as “untouchables”, to stay intact. They do not want the Dalit middle class to prosper and challenge their supremacy. Their policies directly oppose the ideals of India’s democratic constitution. \nBut the dilution of the reservations system is not the only tool they use to set the Dalit progress back and maintain the social inequalities in India. \nCow protection laws \nStrict implementation of cow protection laws across India has been another priority for the BJP government since it came to power in 2014. This caused alarm among Dalits and Adivasis, as they are the main beneficiaries of the cattle economy in the country. \nThis policy also triggered violence against Dalits, Adivasis and other communities that participate in the cattle industry across India. Hindu vigilantes started attacking people who they accused of slaughtering cows. According to the Human Rights Watch, there were at least 38 attacks against members of underprivileged communities over the trade or slaughter of cows for beef in 2017. At least 10 people were killed. \nIn 2016, the state of Gujarat and other parts of India were rocked by protests after four Dalit men in the city of Una were tied to a car, stripped and flogged by Hindu vigilantes, who accused them of skinning a cow. \nIn many cow-related attacks like the one in Una, the 1989 SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act was used to bring perpetrators to justice. Under the act, passed by the government of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1989, anyone accused of committing an atrocity against the members of the scheduled castes and tribes is denied bail. \nOver the years, this act became a big problem for casteist forces in India who want to maintain the oppression of Dalits and other underprivileged communities. The RSS has been training its cadre for decades to oppose any form of social change and suppress any attempts to create a caste-free India, often through violence and intimidation. To continue with their agenda, they needed a mechanism to weaken the Atrocities Act and ensure the Hindu “vigilantes” who attack Dalits would not face imprisonment. \nOn March 20, the Supreme Court of India gave these group what they wanted by passing a verdict which barred the immediate arrest of those accused of violence against SCs and STs. \nThis was the last straw that broke the camel’s back for many Dalits. Dalit intellectuals and activists saw this judgement as what it is: a major blow to Dalit rights and progress. \nAs a result, for the first time since India’s independence 70 years ago, Dalits decided to take collective action. \nYet when they took to the streets to fight for their rights on April 2, the dominant forces in India responded with violence. Protesters were beaten and shot at. A local BJP worker named Raja Chaunan was filmed as he fired his gun on protesters. \nBut even though the protest was violently suppressed, all was not lost. This collective act of resistance showed the governing forces that Dalits are not going to silently take the abuses and discrimination any longer. \nThe middle class that emerged out of this historically oppressed untouchable community is now capable of understanding every step their oppressors take. And they are ready to take action. \nA section of Dalits voted for the BJP in the past, because they believed that Narendra Modi, who has an OBC background himself, could improve their socioeconomic and educational conditions. But Modi has no grip over his party and the RSS and the core RSS and BJP supporters across India view the caste system as an undisputable pillar of a Hindu society. Neither organisation has ever produced literature openly opposing the caste system. \nAll Dalits now see the BJP government as what it is: An RSS offshoot determined to keep them from achieving real equality. And they are ready to resist its attempts to strip them of their hard-earned rights. \nThe Dalit forces are no longer willing to take the abuse, oppression and discrimination lying down. The way the Dalit masses came into the streets across India, waving the dark blue flags of Dalit resistance, made it clear for everyone that a “Dalit Spring” is on the horizon. \nCourtesy Aljazeera ", 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T21:37:41.004+03:00', 'uuid': 'ecaf767a3fa580b3930f5c7cb415288581e42b02', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-09T03:04:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': "A 'Dalit Spring' is on the horizon - Kashmir Images Newspaper", 'site': 'thekashmirimages.com', 'main_image': 'http://thekashmirimages.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/c9a5eeedd86540fe842b62873df26758_18.jpg', 'domain_rank': None, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': "A 'Dalit Spring' is on the horizon - Kashmir Images Newspaper", 'uuid': 'ecaf767a3fa580b3930f5c7cb415288581e42b02', 'site_section': '', 'participants_count': 0, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': [], 'published': '2018-04-09T03:04:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'thekashmirimages.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.024, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr8NpsRmkUZDTxJigiNI9m3cVl2Me4VedFfLN_ZA4DzrEJnceSPy31xDnlULJW7qZ1tZNzxdnUKkH8_m1MPr.1qwxA.ya981Z0-', 'section_title': ''}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'kashmir', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'india', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [], 'organizations': [{'name': 'bharat bandh', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMr8NpsRmkUZDTxJigiNI9m3cVl2Me4VedFfLN_ZA4DzrEJnceSPy31xDnlULJW7qZ1tZNzxdnUKkH8_m1MPr.1qwxA.ya981Z0-', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'CanIndia New Wire Service', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'United opposition will defeat BJP, Modi in 2019: Rahul', 'text': 'United opposition will defeat BJP, Modi in 2019: Rahul   2 Bengaluru, April 8 (IANS) An upbeat Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asserted that a united opposition would defeat the BJP, as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi, in the 2019 general elections. “A united opposition will ensure the defeat of the BJP and prevent Modi from winning again from the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 parliamentary elections,” he said at a media interaction here.

It is difficult in such circumstances to proceed with such initiatives,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told reporters, according to the Times of India. \nSAARC summits are usually held biennially hosted by a member state in alphabetical order. The member state hosting the summit assumes the chair of the association. The last summit was held in Kathmandu in 2014. The following meeting, expected to take place in Islamabad in 2016, had to be postponed after several members, led by India, pulled out on the pretext of ‘security’. \nIndia had expressed its inability to participate in the summit due to “prevailing circumstances” following the terrorist attack \nBut after a deadly attack on an Indian army camp in Uri in occupied Kashmir on September 18, 2016, India stepped up diplomatic pressure on Pakistan. \nBangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan also declined to attend ths summit following India’s nudging. \nMaldives and Sri Lanka are the seventh and eighth members of the initiative. \nDuring his visit to Kathmandu last month, Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had sought Oli’s support for convening the SAARC summit in Islamabad this year. \nIn a speech during a visit to the SAARC Secretariat, Abbasi had said Pakistan has always strived to make SAARC a vibrant vehicle for regional cooperation based on the principle of sovereign equality. He also noted that SAARC had immense potential for strengthening the economies of the member countries and promoting collaboration in various areas of mutual significance. \nHe emphasised that the organisation needed to continue to strive in achieving the economic, cultural and social growth of the region. He stressed the need for an increased level of connectivity among the SAARC member states for a prosperous region. \nAbbasi said that Pakistan, at all meetings of the SAARC, had advanced its belief that a secure and peaceful environment in South Asia was crucial for the advancement of region’s development and prosperity. \nHe said that as the host of the next SAARC summit, Pakistan looks forward to convening the summit at an early date and assured that the country would play a positive role in further strengthening regional cooperation.

Several incidents of statue vandalism have been reported from various parts of the country over the last few months. \nIn addition, Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) Om Prakash Singh wrote a letter to Superintendents of Police (SPs) of all districts regarding the issue and asked them to work in ensuring the statues' security. \nThe latest development comes after several incidents of vandalism of famous personalities, including Mahatma Gandhi, Syama Prasad Mukherjee, E V Ramasamy Periyar and Vladimir Lenin were reported across the country. \nA statue of the Father of Indian Constitution, B R Ambedkar, was vandalised in Bhind's Kheria Village of Madhya Pradesh on Saturday and another one on in Rajasthan's Achrol on Thursday. \nReports of incidents of vandalism of statues started pouring in soon after the results of the Assembly elections in Tripura were declared. Following the victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Left bastion, a mob demolished a statue of Communist ideologue Vladimir Lenin in Tripura. \nThese incidents have sparked a war of words between political parties as well. PM Modi, however, had recently made an appeal to people to not indulge in the vandalism of statues. Following this, the Union Home Ministry had issued a directive to states to ensure that no such incidents take place. \n(With inputs from ANI) ", 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T21:42:34.008+03:00', 'uuid': '3479010e811aba2930207c00627ed1f86937c5b1', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T03:00:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Amid defacing and vandalism spree, UP police shield for statues of famous figures', 'site': 'india.com', 'main_image': 'http://ste.india.com/sites/default/files/2018/04/08/675916-up.jpg', 'domain_rank': 583, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'Amid defacing and vandalism spree, UP police shield for statues of famous figures', 'uuid': '3479010e811aba2930207c00627ed1f86937c5b1', 'site_section': 'http://www.zeenews.com/rss/india-news.xml', 'participants_count': 0, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 7, 'comments': 2, 'likes': 7}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T03:00:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'SG', 'site_full': 'zeenews.india.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/r9R5Oks0axSrqbIEVnzlpgyFZXLFNBcnQiBf92YCP0ENsGDgN2RjzVzIj3fm8dzCQpHqBMEI8Adw76X3U0PALNOfyo9QrVkyMp2486UXD1HixVwmowi3sNUWnN6Jiz6ctqLU87FnqxfiZJ92piOBLcGtAFf3ao7105FNwLqC64I-', 'section_title': 'Zee News :State'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'lucknow', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'arvind kumar', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'ministry of home affairs', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'home department', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'zee media bureau', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'uttar pradesh home department', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'uttar pradesh', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/r9R5Oks0axSrqbIEVnzlpgyFZXLFNBcnQiBf92YCP0ENsGDgN2RjzVzIj3fm8dzCQpHqBMEI8Adw76X3U0PALNOfyo9QrVkyMp2486UXD1HixVwmowi3sNUWnN6Jiz6ctqLU87FnqxfiZJ92piOBLcGtAFf3ao7105FNwLqC64I-', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': '', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'BJP ally SBSP says it is being &#039;ignored&#039; by UP CM Yogi Adityanath', 'text': 'Uttar Pradesh BJP ally SBSP says it is being \'ignored\' by UP CM Yogi Adityanath NDA ally SBSP on Sunday accused UP CM of not following "coalition dharma" and said it felt "ignored" by him. PTI | Updated: Apr 08, 2018, 16:05 PM IST Comments | File photo (PTI) \nLucknow: Amid complaints by some BJP MPs that their problems are not being heard by the UP government, NDA ally SBSP on Sunday accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of not following "coalition dharma" and said it felt "ignored" by him. \n"I will have detailed discussions with BJP president Amit Shah on various issues when he visits Lucknow on April 10 and then decide my party\'s course of action," SBSP leader and UP cabinet minister Om Prakash Rajbhar told media persons here. \nHe said the SBSP would rethink about the alliance if Shah did not agree on the issues raised by the party. \nAttacking the UP chief minister, Rajbhar said, "Why are MPs and MLAs angry with the (Adityanath) government? Why are they going to Delhi to convey their grievances? Why are the MLAs angry and are sitting on protests?" \nAbout the recent appointments made in the UP secondary education board, he said, "The BJP\'s slogan of \'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas\' is not being implemented in letter and spirit as relatives of senior BJP leaders from upper caste have been appointed. Now tell me where will the people from backward castes and scheduled castes will go?" \n"At meetings of the UP Cabinet, everyone\'s views are heard but the decision is taken by just four-five people. If we have voted for you, then we should also have a say," he said. \nA sulking Rajbhar had last month rushed to Delhi with his complaint and met the BJP chief. \nHe returned to Lucknow a bit mollified when Shah promised to visit the state capital on April 10 and hear him in detail in the presence of the chief minister. \n"I will tell you what the BJP wants and what Om Prakash Rajbhar wants after April 10," he said. \n"If he (Shah) does not agree on the issues raised by us, as he had promised (during a meeting in Delhi ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls), we will have to re-think about the alliance," he said, replying to a question. \nBefore the Rajya Sabha elections in UP, Rajbhar had threatened that his four MLAs would boycott the voting. \nThe SBSP has four MLAs in the 403-member UP Assembly, where the BJP and its allies have a brute majority of 324 lawmakers. \nThe SBSP leader was also critical of the BJP\'s decision not to select the chief minister from among the 325 elected NDA MLAs (one of them later died) in the state. \n"It appears that all of them were worthless," he said. \nRajbhar had recently said that corruption had increased in Uttar Pradesh under the present dispensation and that his party was not getting the due respect from the senior coalition partner. \n"Now their (BJP\'s) own MPs and MLAs are speaking against them and sitting on dharna... Look at the statements coming from people occupying responsible positions... There has to be something behind their speaking like this," he said. \nHe was referring to Lok Sabha MPs fron Etawah and Nagina, Ashok Kumar Dohrey and Yashwant Singh respectively, who are the latest to join other Dalit colleagues, who have publicly expressed their unhappiness, especially after the recent protests against the Supreme Court order on the SC/ST Act. \nEarlier, Robertsganj Lok Sabha MP Chhotelal had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused Adityanath of "scolding" him when he went to take up an issue with him. \nWhile these three Dalit parliamentarians of the BJP have approached Modi with their concerns, Bahraich MP Savitri Bai Phoole has virtually turned a rebel, triggering speculation that she might join the BSP, which she had earlier quit to join the BJP. \nPhoole had slammed the Modi government for its stance on the apex court order on the SC/ST Act, saying it smacked of a conspiracy to scrap reservation for Dalits. \nThe 37-year-old lawmaker from Bahraich went on to organise a mass rally in Lucknow on April 1, a day before the nationwide protests that saw Dalit anger spill over to streets across the country.

What he left unsaid was that thousands lost their lives and millions were displaced during Pakistan’s military operations against the Taliban and Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM) militants in Swat over the past decade, and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Jundallah extremists in Balochistan since 1948.\nThe Pakistani deep state is unhappy at Janjua engaging Bisaria after the counter-terror operations in Kashmir, with foreign minister Khawaja Asif and former interior minister Nisar Ahmed Chaudhry taking strong exception to the meeting at a time when, according to them, Kashmiris are facing “state terrorism”.\nHowever, the two countries decided to take incremental steps on the humanitarian front to remove deep-seated negativity among the populace on both sides of the border. Among the suggested steps was a proposal to revive the joint judicial committee, defunct since 2008, to exchange mentally unsound prisoners and fishermen who find their way to jails in the other country. This was first proposed by external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj to the Pakistan High Commissioner in October 2017 and Islamabad responded to it on March 7, 2018.\nThe April 3 meeting reiterated the commitment of both countries to move forward on this, apart from ending harassment of diplomats on both sides. The officials cited above said Bisaria has also been assured by Pakistan foreign secretary Tehmina Janjua of membership of the Islamabad Club.\nExperts say Pakistan’s willingness to take steps to improve its relations with India is largely due to pressure from the Trump administration, which wants Islamabad to deliver on the terror front or else be prepared for hard steps from Washington. The grey-listing of Pakistan by Financial Action Task Force (FATF) followed by the US designation of Milli Muslim League, a party floated by 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed, as a terrorist outfit on April 2 are indicators that Trump administration is mulling additional steps to ensure that terror factories are closed by Islamabad. An official statement issued in Islamabad after Bisaria’s meeting with Janjua said they discussed ways to improve bilateral relations and the “recent worsening situation” in Kashmir. Janjua expressed “serious concerns” over alleged rights violations and said the “use of force alone can lead us nowhere”, the statement said.\nThe statement said Bisaria acknowledged the two countries need to improve their relations and suggested working on “small steps” such as the exchange of prisoners, visits of medical teams and trade initiatives. The envoy and Janjua agreed to explore possibilities for cooperation and improving relations to move towards a “comprehensive process of dialogue”.\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/indi...sa-to-india/story-K8aotNbITMIIlC6uzbWR1L.html Click to expand...\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T21:43:57.010+03:00', 'uuid': '762c61f68f17987da06d9b46651db7dc24655ed5', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T04:11:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 4, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Win Kashmiri hearts the way we have in Balochistan: Pakistan NSA to India', 'site': 'defence.pk', 'main_image': 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/04/07/Pictures/india-kashmir-student-protests_7485f2b8-3a09-11e8-90dd-823da00706aa.jpg', 'domain_rank': 23494, 'site_type': 'discussions', 'title': 'Win Kashmiri hearts the way we have in Balochistan: Pakistan NSA to India', 'uuid': '5848dd83037c6900d59a149a3ffee185a75a1dc1', 'site_section': 'https://defence.pk/pdf/forums/central-south-asia.160/', 'participants_count': 9, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-07T06:28:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'PK', 'site_full': 'defence.pk', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 6, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5rUY47JSFNbSXVd5lKHle9Z298839tg9i35SgCWX4fY2Ve7iyUVb.lg3tXUO.FLP5SSxv2K_u5JENSMQGQSsTJYc4yGlRq2daa6fiK48hij4gMZ5ETc.agq_ZIdpGIMsK.j3Fk7ZTMA--', 'section_title': 'Central &amp; South Asia'}, 'entities': {'locations': [], 'persons': [], 'organizations': []}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR5rUY47JSFNbSXVd5lKHle9Z298839tg9i35SgCWX4fY2Ve7iyUVb.lg3tXUO.FLP5SSxv2K_u5JENSMQGQSsTJYc4yGlRq2daa6fiK48hij4gMZ5ETc.agq_ZIdpGIMv5PrBAh3yU_UwVPlpKigAj', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'Admin6', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Clash Between Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley?', 'text': 'Clash Between Amit Shah and Arun Jaitley?

Launched in 2015, the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY) was introduced to cater to entrepreneurs who were either in their early stage or require lesser funds in order to get their business running. As the scheme completed three years of its launch on Sunday, Modi tweeted his delight and said that his government was undertaking a series of steps and reforms to facilitate further growth in the sector. “Through Mudra Yojana, the MSME sector is receiving a substantial impetus. MSME is a sector that is crucial for India’s transformation and our government is undertaking a series of steps and reforms to facilitate further growth in the sector,” Modi said. He said the Mudra Yojana was furthering a spirit of enterprise and self-reliance among youth and women. The scheme was launched for providing loans upto Rs 10 lakh to the non-corporate, non-farm small and micro enterprises. “A substantial number of Mudra beneficiaries are women and youngsters from the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Class communities, which is extremely heartening,” he said. He said the PMMY was launched to give wings to the aspirations of citizens and harness the entrepreneurial energy among youth. “…I am delighted to see how Mudra Yojana has brought prosperity in the lives of many.” The Prime Minister also took the opportunity to invite the beneficiaries of the scheme to share their success stories and said he would meet some of them at his official residence on April 11. “Dear friends on social media, do share with me success stories of Mudra Yojana that you know about. I would love to meet some of the friends from the world of social media who share these stories,” he said. “…I look forward to a special programme!… It would be wonderful to speak to them and personally hear about their journeys,” he said.

But, the MPs should have raised their grievances at a relevant party forum, he added. Kishore dismissed rumours doing the rounds that angry lawmakers were voicing their grievances in public at the behest of rival political parties, which might have entered into a secret pact with the disgruntled leaders. “There is not an iota of truth in this. No ticket has been finalised as of now for the Lok Sabha elections, which are at least a year away. We generally speak to each other on a host of issues, but they did not complain that they are angry,” the MP from Mohanlalganj in Lucknow said. After facing strident criticism from the Opposition on Dalit issues, the BJP is now grappling with a rising voice of discontent among its MPs belonging to Scheduled Castes in UP. Lok Sabha members from Etawah and Nagina, Ashok Kumar Dohrey and Yashwant Singh respectively, were the latest to join other Dalit colleagues, who have publicly expressed their unhappiness, especially after the recent protests by the community over a Supreme Court ruling on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Dohrey had alleged that Dalits and tribals across the country, especially in UP, were being framed by the police in false cases after the protests, leading to growing insecurity among them.

Rahul Gandhi attacks Amit Shah for his comments \n\nCongress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday slammed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) national president Amit Shah for likening opposition parties to animals, which is disrespectful to all Indians. \n"Calling the opposition parties animals exposes Shah\'s mentality and reflects the vision of the BJP and its parent organisation RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh). It\'s disrespectful to all Indians," Gandhi told reporters at the Kolar Gold Fields (KGF), about 100km from here. \nAddressing a rally to mark the BJP\'s 38th Foundation Day in Mumbai on Friday, Shah likened the opposition parties to "dogs, cats, snakes and mongoose", as they were trying to unite against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the 2019 general elections. \n"By equating us with animals, Shah has revealed that there were only two humans - Modi and he himself in the country," mocked Gandhi during his visit to Kolar district to campaign for the ruling Congress ahead of the May 12 Karnataka Assembly polls. \n"It\'s unfortunate he (Shah) looks at the world that way and thinks everyone else are animals. But we don\'t take seriously whatever Shah says," asserted Gandhi. \nShah, however, later clarified that he did not intend to hurt anyone by calling them animals as the context in which he used dogs, cats and snakes was different and meant those whose ideologies were contradictory. \nBlaming BJP\'s senior leaders like L.K. Advani and Murali Manohar Joshi for not showing guts to speak out, Gandhi said for Shah and Modi, even Dalits, tribals, minorities and everybody else were worthless. \n"Shah and Modi are convinced that they are the only two human beings in this country and all others are not. That\'s the reality," lamented Gandhi. \nLater, addressing a huge rally at the party\'s "Jan Ashirvada Yatra" to seek the people\'s blessings for the Congress victory in the ensuing assembly election, Gandhi said Modi failed to fulfil a single promise he made to the youth of the country. \n"Instead of creating two crore jobs for the youth of the country, Modi snatched away thousands of jobs by signing a deal with a French company (Dassault Aviation) to buy Rafale fighters for the IAF and denied HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd) making them in India," reiterated Gandhi. \nClaiming that the Congress would defeat the BJP-RSS combine in the upcoming assembly election, the party chief said the saffron brigade would also be defeated in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where assembly elections are due later this year. \n"Finally, we will defeat the BJP-RSS ideology in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019," said Gandhi."Modi\'s mood has changed. He is scared and confused knowing that time is running out. \nHe has also realised that the Congress is coming to power," claimed Gandhi.- ', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T21:58:34.002+03:00', 'uuid': '1a1d7ad663bbb309dc03219d9d3f534666387f37', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T12:33:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Rahul Gandhi slams Amit Shah for calling opposition parties animals', 'site': 'jagranjosh.com', 'main_image': '//images.jagran.com/rahul_detained_big.jpg', 'domain_rank': 4646, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'Rahul Gandhi slams Amit Shah for calling opposition parties animals', 'uuid': '1a1d7ad663bbb309dc03219d9d3f534666387f37', 'site_section': '', 'participants_count': 0, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['homework_study_tips', 'education'], 'published': '2018-04-08T12:33:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'www.jagranjosh.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.187, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcMQlNCOK6yJP6b8TNsJHhXu1jbJsK50Ikt.RSFly1w3XvuG1ZEUnQwjsxvsVDtUXU5gjlnDKQKzcAuLapPLZh8WlONjoXQk.VP1smiO7hP7EEdy8VEk9TLhZCkRSiUO4oafGZwaY9v7jOh6LTCObHbvASVQDkAtpp_L8r_ogoGw--', 'section_title': ''}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'new delhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'mumbai', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'rahul gandhi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'amit shah', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'gandhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'shah', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'congress', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bharatiya janata party', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'jagran josh/ with agency inputs sun', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bjp', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'kgf', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'rashtriya swayamsevak sangh', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcMQlNCOK6yJP6b8TNsJHhXu1jbJsK50Ikt.RSFly1w3XvuG1ZEUnQwjsxvsVDtUXU5gjlnDKQKzcAuLapPLZh8WlONjoXQk.VP1smiO7hP7EEdy8VEk9TLhZCkRSiUO4oafGZwaY9v7jOh6LTCObHbvASVQDkAtpp_L8r_ogoGw--', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'Jagran Josh Trending', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Cauvery Protest, Rahul Gandhi, Commonwealth Games: Top stories of the day', 'text': "Cauvery Protest, Rahul Gandhi, Commonwealth Games: Top stories of the day Jagran Josh Trending New Delhi , Jagran Josh Sun, 08 Apr 2018 16:23 IST \nCut the clutter and read evening bulletin to know the top 10 stories of the day.

BJP MPs\' statements prove beyond doubt that PM Modi was working towards a \'Dalit-mukt\' India," Shergill said. \nBJP MPs have exposed Modi\'s "anti-Dalit" mindset and policies, he added. \nTaking a dig at the Prime Minister\'s directive to his party MPs to spend a night in a village with over 50 per cent Dalits and tribals population, he said the prime minister should first call his party\'s Dalit MPs to his house to address their concerns rather than doing these "PR stunts". \nThe statements of BJP\'s Dalit MPs - Udit Raj, Savitri Bai Phule, Chhote Lal Kharwar, Ashok Kumar Dohre and Yashwant Singh have punctured the government\'s tall claims, he said. \nThese Lok Sabha members have expressed concerns over issues facing Dalits. \nWhile some of the MPs like Udit Raj and Dohre have not targeted their party\'s top brass outright others like Singh and Phule have been explicit in their criticism of the government. \nModi\'s "stoic silence" shows the BJP-RSS is working towards making India Dalit-free and he was "enjoying" the anguish and pain of the scheduled castes and tribes, Shergill alleged.

(Photo | PTI) NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned down Railway Minister Piyush Goyal\'s ambitious plan to convert Mumbai\'s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus into one of the first museum-cum-railway stations in India, ministry sources said. \nThe terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878. \nIt was designed on the late medieval Italian models and it was elevated to the status of a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2004. \nGoyal had announced to convert the busy terminal into a "world-class museum" during his visit there in November. \nDuring a meeting attended by Goyal and senior Railway Board members on March 26, Prime Minister Modi questioned the logic behind such ambitious projects, the sources said. \nThey said the Railway Board was also against Goyal\'s museum proposal, which could displace a lot of employees and it would be difficult to accommodate them somewhere else. \nRailway zones, too, had objected to it. \nThe prime minister is understood to have remarked on the lack of railway artifacts that could be showcased in the proposed museum, which, the sources said, were not enough. \nThe bids for the Rs 250-million project was invited by Railway\'s subsidiary RITES, which likely received response from top architectural conservation and building restoration firms. \nAt least 13 companies have submitted expressions of interest to design the two floors of the terminal into a museum complex, the sources say. \nThey indicated that the prime minister has also cast a shadow on Goyal\'s ambitious electrification plan and his efforts to modernise the train signalling system by bringing in an European model - both of which are now likely put on hold. \nMoreover, Goyal wanted the Railways to hire more safai karmacharis but has been asked to make do with the existing staff, the sources said. \nAll the PMO\'s objections, they said, have now been published as minutes of the meeting and thus documented. \n"During the meeting, the ministry was asked to concentrate on projects that are implementable. \nThese projects had objections from the Board, zones and even in certain cases the Finance Ministry," the sources said.

(File | PTI) \nBENGALURU/NEW DELHI: Seeking to wrest power from the Congress in Karnataka, the BJP in its first list of 72 candidates has included state party heavyweights like B S Yeddyurappa, K S Eshwarappa, B Sriramulu and Congress defectors like Malikayya Venkayya Guttedar. \nThe BJP Central Election Committee at its meeting chaired by party chief Amit Shah and attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday approved the first list for the May 12 Karnataka Assembly elections. The meeting was preceded by a show of strength with the BJP inducting former Congress MLA Malikayya Guttedar. He found mention in the first list of candidates, with the BJP fielding him from Alzalpur constituency. Another defector, Mallikarjun Khuba, has been accommodated in Basavakalyan. \nBJP’s chief ministerial candidate Yeddyurappa will contest from his bastion Shikaripura constituency. Resting all speculation, the party will field Eshwarappa from Shivamogga constituency. The ticket to Eshwarappa, who lost his seat in 2013, comes as no surprise as the leader has made all the right calls including hosting a dinner for party president Amit Shah in Shivamogga when the latter visited the district last week. The dinner diplomacy seems to have worked for him. \nSriramulu, a close aide of the infamous Reddy brothers, will be contesting away from Ballari — a seat he famously won after he parted ways with the BJP just before the 2013 elections. This time round he will contest from Molakalmuru. \nSitting MLAs Aravind Limbavali, Vijayakumar, Appachu Ranjan, R Ashoka, Ravi Subramanya, S Suresh Kumar, Ashwath Narayana, C T Ravi, S Muniraju, S Raghu, Haladi Srinivas Shetty, Basavraj Bommai, Jagadish Shettar, CM Udasi, Kageri Vishwanath, Govind Karjol, Laxman Savadi among others will contest from the seats they won in the last election. \nThe next list of BJP, largely comprising controversial seats, is likely to be announced in the third week of this month.The BJP’s CEC meeting was preceded by marathon meetings of Shah with key party leaders, including Yeddyurappa, Union Ministers — Prakash Javdekar, Ananth Kumar, besides general secretaries — P Mualidhar Rao, Anil Jain and Bhupendra Yadav. \nLingayat factor \nThe meeting also took stock of the Congress bid to make inroads into the saffron base in the Lingayat community and state govt’s decision to accord minority religion status.

Here’s why including entrepreneurship development in academic curriculum is important Unemployment is on the rise in India. One reason is the lack of understanding about market requirements among young people on the threshold of a new career. Education cannot prevent unemployment. Published: April 9, 2018 12:03 AM Unemployment is on the rise in India. One reason is the lack of understanding about market requirements among young people on the threshold of a new career. Education cannot prevent unemployment. \nUnemployment is on the rise in India. One reason is the lack of understanding about market requirements among young people on the threshold of a new career. Education cannot prevent unemployment. A large number of graduates are unable to find jobs because our universities fail to promote the innovative and entrepreneurial attitude necessary today, not just for entrepreneurs, but also for employees. Even as graduates after graduates pass out of universities, their lack of requisite skills stands in the way of getting a break. They have a degree, but not a job. \nGrowing disconnect \nAt the root of the problem is the disconnect between university education and the requirements of the economy and society. Most academic courses are heavily theory-oriented with hardly any practical component. Add to this the infirmities in planning and implementation of economic development and the lack of focused approach to training human resources for specialised jobs, and we have the recipe for mounting unemployment. So despite PM Narendra Modi ’s exhortations of Make-in-India, our graduates are always looking for jobs (mostly unsuccessfully) and not able to create any. \nInculcating entrepreneurship \nThe fast-changing economic environment is creating new challenges. Entrepreneurship is becoming a priority on the national agenda in most developing countries. It serves as an engine for growth, employment and wealth generation. The need to develop entrepreneurial skills to create new businesses, use unused capacities and develop new capabilities to solve economic and social problems cannot be overemphasised. It allows people, using expertise and ingenuity, to create opportunities and and generate employment and income. Entrepreneurship training can be done in different ways and by various methods, but is most effective if it is included as part of university curriculum. \nSystematic and goal-oriented \nIntroducing entrepreneurship education in the curriculum requires planning and research. It has to be a systematic and goal-oriented process. The objective should be to introduce students to the concept of entrepreneurship and to develop skills in those who show potential. This would entail increasing students’ knowledge about entrepreneurial career and helping them understand the process of setting up and managing a new business; increasing their knowledge of potential businesses and start-ups; improving their ability to be self-employed; and providing an understanding of the role of new enterprises in the economy. But, above all, it would involve instilling in them the spirit of taking risks, embracing change. Entrepreneurship education has the potential to build skills and competencies, and a good teacher can inculcate such skills, knowledge and attitude in students. \nInnovative techniques \nWe need to devise modern teaching techniques to build students’ capabilities through problem-based learning, industry apprenticeship and proper funding. Appropriate teaching methodologies and relevant learning processes must be identified and adopted. Teachers must be well-trained and motivated to promote an entrepreneurial attitude among students. Institutions could tie-up with industries to develop the entrepreneurial component in the curriculum. A joint effort will be mutually beneficial. It can ensure that students inclined towards entrepreneurship are identified and groomed. The skills of teachers could improve the competencies of entrepreneurs, leading to growth and strengthening of the economy. \nNarendra Kumar Shyamsukha \nThe author is chairman, ICA Edu Skills, a pan-India vocational training and placement institute \nGet live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds , calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator , know market’s Top Gainers , Top Losers & Best Equity Funds .

By: Jitendra K Das | Published: April 9, 2018 12:02 AM The drive to attain the label of ‘world-class institution’ is becoming stronger by the day, particularly as a credibility measure, considering the relatively poor image of Indian institutions in the international arena. \nThe drive to attain the label of ‘world-class institution’ is becoming stronger by the day, particularly as a credibility measure, considering the relatively poor image of Indian institutions in the international arena. The active presence of international accreditation agencies in India is an indication of this. Addressing the centenary celebrations at the Patna University last year, PM Narendra Modi had said it is a blot that no Indian university figures among the top few in the world, while in the past universities such as Nalanda and Taxila attracted students from across the globe. In line with this, to ensure ‘greater excellence and innovation’ in higher education, the government had announced a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore for five years to 10 private and 10 government universities to be chosen by the government. Further, these 20 institutions would be free from the constraints of government rules and regulations in order to facilitate them to emerge as world-class institutions. While this initiative is welcome, the exclusive pursuit of status and ranks by a few chosen universities, rather than by all institutions who meet a certain milestone to become the ‘chosen one’, may not be able to achieve the objective. The desire and ability of institutions who wish to push their frontiers to achieve this must be given a chance. \nThe identification of these ‘chosen ones’ who may not want government funding but they, for sure, would want full autonomy must be on an auto mode, i.e. milestone-based, to increase the prospect of success from India perspective. The Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business (ISB) getting one of the top global ranks in a recent Financial Times ranking is a case in point. The ISB is not governed by any Indian academic regulator and does not take government funds. It is not appropriate for a country like India to invest a huge amount of taxpayer money to fund the effort of only a few universities to attain global rankings, precluding others who also may have intent. All options to make fund utilisation optimal must be explored. For example, to encourage fund flow into higher education—a non-profit activity—the government may do well to incentivise private fund flow through tax exemption. This would ensure, at current corporate tax rates, three times the tax forgone by the government into higher education. If the government forgoes Rs 2,000 crore as tax revenue adjusted against the corpus, then about Rs 6,000 crore can flow into higher education from private sources. \nAdd this to the Rs 10,000 crore fund outlay, and the total fund mobilised would be Rs 14,000 crore. To further strengthen fund flow, the mandatory corporate CSR activity can be aligned with higher education in line with the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2016. Such a redefinition will broaden the scope of institutions wanting to push their boundaries and, thus, improve the chance of success in meeting the objectives. The fund allocation in its current form appears inefficient and of skewed priority. It must also be understood that the bygone era Nalanda and Taxila universities received grants from the kings and thereafter the kings neither asked questions on fund utilisation nor were there any audits. These universities did with funds what they considered the best. In the current Indian context, the impact of questions that may be asked by government agencies on fund utilisation by private universities, in particular, can be a matter of a debate. Milestone-based parity in raising or utilisation of funds, autonomy, competition and government monitoring in equal measure for all educational institutions must be the only way to fast-track higher education reform in India. \n\nGet live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds , calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator , know market’s Top Gainers , Top Losers & Best Equity Funds .

By: PTI | Updated: April 8, 2018 11:40 PM Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned down Railway Minister Piyush Goyal’s ambitious plan to convert Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus into one of the first museum-cum-railway stations in India. \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has turned down Railway Minister Piyush Goyal’s ambitious plan to convert Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus into one of the first museum-cum-railway stations in India, ministry sources said. \nThe terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878. It was designed on the late medieval Italian models and it was elevated to the status of a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2004. \nGoyal had announced to convert the busy terminal into a “world-class museum” during his visit there in November. \nDuring a meeting attended by Goyal and senior Railway Board members on March 26, Prime Minister Modi questioned the logic behind such ambitious projects, the sources said. \nThey said the Railway Board was also against Goyal’s museum proposal, which could displace a lot of employees and it would be difficult to accommodate them somewhere else. \nRailway zones, too, had objected to it. \nThe prime minister is understood to have remarked on the lack of railway artifacts that could be showcased in the proposed museum, which, the sources said, were not enough. \nThe bids for the Rs 250-million project was invited by Railway’s subsidiary RITES, which likely received response from top architectural conservation and building restoration firms. \nAt least 13 companies have submitted expressions of interest to design the two floors of the terminal into a museum complex, the sources say. \nThey indicated that the prime minister has also cast a shadow on Goyal’s ambitious electrification plan and his efforts to modernise the train signalling system by bringing in an European model – both of which are now likely put on hold. \nMoreover, Goyal wanted the Railways to hire more safai karmacharis but has been asked to make do with the existing staff, the sources said. \nAll the PMO’s objections, they said, have now been published as minutes of the meeting and thus documented. \n“During the meeting, the ministry was asked to concentrate on projects that are implementable. These projects had objections from the Board, zones and even in certain cases the Finance Ministry,” the sources said. \nGet live Stock Prices from BSE and NSE and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds , calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator , know market’s Top Gainers , Top Losers & Best Equity Funds .

An upbeat Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asserted that a united opposition would defeat the BJP, as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi, in the 2019 general elections. "A united opposition will ensure the defeat of the BJP and prevent Modi from winning again from the Varanasi Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 parliamentary elections," he said at a media interaction here. Hinting at the coming together of the Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for 2019, Gandhi said the opposition parties would keep aside their regional aspirations and personal ambitions to jointly bring down the BJP and Modi next year. "Forget the BJP and Modi winning in the next elections. I foresee the ruling NDA coalition collapsing as never before," he predicted. Gandhi was on a two-day visit to the southern state since Saturday for the sixth time in two months to campaign for the party. "I don\'t see the BJP winning the next election in the face of a united opposition and rising public anger against its government and leadership," he said. In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Gandhi said the Congress would not only win in Karnataka, but also in Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were assembly elections are due later this year. "How and from where will the BJP win seats when other opposition and regional parties close ranks and contest jointly against it in the 2019 polls?" he asked. <p>Advertisement</p> ADVERTISEMENT Gandhi also ruled out a third front against the Congress and the BJP in the next year\'s general elections. Later, Gandhi participated at the ruling party\'s \'Jan Ashirvada Yatra\', held for the people\'s blessings in the May 12 Karnataka assembly election. Noting that the assembly poll would be a battle of ideologies between the Congress and the BJP, Gandhi said Bengaluru\'s founder Kempegowda and Karnataka\'s 12th century social reformer Basavanna had taught people how to take everyone together for the good of all and on the development path. "Bengaluru is the symbol of modern India. Besides (state-run enterprises like) HAL, ISRO, BEL, BEML and ITI, it has best academic and research institutions like IISc and IIM, which attracted global IT firms and multinationals," said Gandhi, who earlier in the day, interacted with workers of the city civic corporation, women entrepreneurs and top executives of India Inc here.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:12:10.015+03:00', 'uuid': '833c175f7856af3c7202478d1e9b9f3592b4b3e0', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T22:06:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'United opposition will defeat BJP, Modi in 2019: Rahul Gandhi', 'site': 'netindian.in', 'main_image': 'http://netindian.in/sites/default/files/1935861_110274917099_300842_n.jpg', 'domain_rank': None, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'United opposition will defeat BJP, Modi in 2019: Rahul Gandhi', 'uuid': '833c175f7856af3c7202478d1e9b9f3592b4b3e0', 'site_section': 'http://netindian.in/rss.xml', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T22:06:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'IN', 'site_full': 'netindian.in', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUGV7tFVvUG9CqQBhC.M7Kr1yycRiFoSWyhq.C5E0eU5qbxPMVMal2THYrsGQfm6o10opidX78e86l9CaSMZLfHc3q83ZQXkWgHYLuBlanBmf_Nu9PiPT8T4R4KGYP51ZM-', 'section_title': 'NetIndian'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'varanasi lok sabha', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'varanasi', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'rahul gandhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'gandhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'congress', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'united', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bjp', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bahujan samaj party', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'samajwadi party', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'nda', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUGV7tFVvUG9CqQBhC.M7Kr1yycRiFoSWyhq.C5E0eU5qbxPMVMal2THYrsGQfm6o10opidX78e86l9CaSMZLfHc3q83ZQXkWgHYLuBlanBmf_Nu9PiPT8T4R4KGYP51ZM-', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'Editor1', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Under united Oppn, even Modi may lose Varanasi in 2019: Rahul', 'text': 'Bengaluru \nForget the BJP winning the 2019 polls, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi might lose his Varanasi seat under a united opposition, asserted Congress president Rahul Gandhi today. Pegging his confidence on opposition unity, Gandhi said far from the BJP winning the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, even Modi might lose from Varanasi if his party, the SP and the BSP were united against him. Exuding confidence over roping in and managing alliance partners despite their varied personal and regional aspirations, Gandhi predicted for the current ruling dispensation, a "collapse" not "seen in many years." "Frankly, I don\'t see the BJP winning the next election, so in 2019 we will go back to the normal, I sense," he said in reply to a question on "Dalit anger." "...because there are two basic things, once opposition unity goes above a certain level, it becomes impossible to win elections. Now the opposition unity has gone to a point. It\'s simple," Gandhi said at an informal media interaction. Pointing at the opposition unity efforts in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and by the DMK, the Trinamool Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party in Tamil Nadu, Gandhi asked, "Where are they (BJP) going to win seats?" And in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab. We will take it over." "You are going to see a collapse of the style you haven\'t seen in many years," he said. Gandhi was on the sixth leg of campaigning as part of the \'Janashirvada Yatra\' ahead of the May 12 polls in Karnataka. Responding to a question doubting the forging of opposition unity amid varied aspirations of each party and their leaders, Gandhi expressed confidence of overcoming it. "We will manage it. We in the Congress know how to carry people, we are not egotistical people, we don\'t crush people and we don\'t destroy people\'s lives, so we will manage it," he said. The basic thing is how to get the country out of the "mess that Mr Modi and RSS has put it in," he said. The Congress president also ruled out emergence of any third front. Accusing the RSS of generating anger and hatred, Gandhi alleged that people are being killed for what they are saying and that needs to be put to an end. "The natural sort of political environment where there is a little bit of acrimony, but not hatred, needs to be restored," he said. Stating that Modi had a "very good" opportunity after the 2014 election, Gandhi said a lot could have been done for the country. Terming as "funny" the BJP\'s confidence of breaking the opposition alliance in Uttar Prdesh and claiming that he understands UP politics, Rahul said when the three parties (SP, BSP and Congress) come together, "BJP will win only two seats, that too with luck. He said even Modi may lose if he stands from Varanasi and the three parties were united against him. "In fact, I challenge him to stand with three parties united," he added. The BSP and the SP jointly fought Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats during the recent bypolls, costing the BJP both the seats, vacated respectively by Uttar Pradesh chief minister and deputy chief minister. Hitting out at Modi and the BJP, the Congress president said they have lost track of running the country. "You can\'t run this country as an individual, you have to run this country by listening to it, by working with it... and now after four years, he (Modi) has suddenly lost it, because now the wheels are running on them. Everybody can see that, you can hear it in his speeches," he said. Responding to a question, Rahul blamed the "mentality" for Modi and BJP losing track. He said, "...it is the mentality... you stand in front of Basavanna (12th century social reformer from Karnataka) or Ambedkar, praise them, and then you destroy everything that they stood for..." "Basavanna is an idea, he is the representative of idea of Karnataka, you can go and stand in front of his statue as much as you want, but it won\'t work if you are destroying the idea... so, it is the mentality..." he said.

They had appealed to the PM that the government file a review petition in the Supreme Court. \nSince then, some of them have either given vent to their anger by writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, or gone public. Apart from Raj, Bahraich MP Savitri Bai Phule has addressed public meetings to say that she couldn’t care less if a party ticket was denied to her in 2019, but would fight any effort to end reservations or amend the Constitution. \nNageen MP Yashwant Singh, Robertsganj's Chhote Lal Kharwar and Etawah MP Ashok Kumar Doharey have written to the PM. In his letter, Kharwar said Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath was “casteist”. Singh, in his letter to the PM, said the Modi government has done nothing for Dalits in the last four years. \nAfter the April 2 protests, Doharey also wrote to the PM to complain that Dalits were being harassed and implicated in false cases. Now, Raj has joined Doharey in flagging the issue of Dalits being tortured at a “large scale” after the April 2 countrywide agitation. \nRaj tweeted that people from Barmer, Jalore, Jaipur, Gwalior, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Karoli and other parts of the country are calling up to inform that not only anti-reservationists, but police are also beating up and slapping false cases against those who participated in the April 2 ‘Bharat Bandh’. The former revenue service officer said a Gwalior based worker of his is being tortured when he has not done anything wrong. \nOn Sunday, however, Raj tried to limit the damage. “My tweets are being misconstrued that these are harming the BJP. Rather the tweets strengthen (the party), and that there are people like me in BJP who are concerned with Dalit atrocities after the April 2 agitation. This will convince Dalits and they will remain with the party. The government will check anti-Dalit officers/people,” Raj said. \nThe BJP won all the 17 Scheduled Caste reserved seats in Uttar Pradesh in 2014 Lok Sabha. Several of its Dalit MPs had been imported from other parties. However, they are concerned with the Bahujan Samaj Party and Samajwadi Party planning to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha together. \nIn Mumbai on Friday, BJP chief Amit Shah tried to dispel “propaganda” that the Modi government might end reservation. Next week, the BJP has planned a sustained Dalit outreach. On April 11, it will celebrate the birth anniversary of Dalit icon Jyotiba Phule. On April 13, the PM will inaugurate a memorial to BR Ambedkar in Delhi, and on April 14, Ambedkar’s birth anniversary, BJP workers have been asked to spend the night at the house of a Dalit in 20,000 villages. \nBut the murmurings are likely to reach a crescendo among the party’s Dalit MPs in the coming weeks.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) might persist in using issues like the advocacy of militant vegetarianism and “nationalism” to answer the caste challenge. \nBeneath the political potency that such factious subjects have, Karnataka is grappling with more serious state-related matters that impinge as much upon the Centre’s ability to adjudicate fairly and seek resolution. \nOne of the issues is a perennial one, involving the distribution of the waters from the rivers flowing through Karnataka and its neighbours. The issue works up emotions to the same degree as a communal one might and sets off conflicts between local communities. If the Cauvery water-sharing dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu — dating back to 1892 between the erstwhile Madras Presidency under the British Raj and the princely Mysore state — has exploded again into a war, the discord between Karnataka and Goa over dividing the water of the Mahadayi river simmers under the surface. The altercation might have blown up before the Assembly elections, had Goa Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar not been out of action. Parrikar is away in the US for medical treatment. \nTamil Nadu’s principal Opposition party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), called a “bandh” on April 6 to protest a Supreme Court ruling on Cauvery and the Centre’s “inability” to work for an amicable resolution despite being directed by the apex court to seek one. To retaliate, Karnataka activist Vatal Nagaraj has announced a shutdown on April 12 to force the Centre not to “succumb” to the DMK’s pressure for setting up the Cauvery Management Board. Nagaraj is not a peasant leader in the mould of Karnataka legends like K S Puttamaiah and Professor M D Nanjundaswamy because he is used to flagging issues that play on popular emotions and could fuel the rhetoric used by political parties. Cauvery is one of them because in 2017 Nagaraj protested against comments made by Sathyaraj, a Tamil film actor, during a Cauvery agitation spearheaded by the Tamil Nadu Actors’ Association. \nALSO READ: Karnataka polls a test case for Amit Shah: Many big guns training in run-up \nOn February 16 this year, the Supreme Court tweaked the 2007 verdict of the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal (set up in 1990) and increased Karnataka’s share at Tamil Nadu’s expense. The court also directed the Centre to formulate a scheme for apportioning water between Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry but the Narendra Modi government sought a three-month extension, citing the Assembly elections as the reason. If and when it comes to the crunch, the political belief is that the BJP will likely tilt towards Karnataka, where its political investments far exceed those in Tamil Nadu. \nThe 765-km-long Cauvery originates in Karnataka’s Kodagu district and flows through Hassan, Mandya and Mysore in the Old Mysuru region before entering Tamil Nadu. Old Mysuru has the lion’s share of 65 Assembly seats (out of the 224) and has traditionally seen a direct fight between the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular). The BJP just about exists in 10 seats. \nALSO READ: Battle for Karnataka: Congress' biggest challenges lie within, not in BJP \nAlthough it has featured less in the public domain, the Goa-Karnataka fracas over portioning out the Mahadayi waters has proved as intractable as Cauvery. The dispute, when it began in July 1980, was confined to the Malaprabha command area. Called the Naragund rebellion, the area’s farmers revolted against the then chief minister R Gundu Rao’s decision to collect a betterment levy without providing water from the Mahadayi. \nGoa was irked by Karnataka’s move to design and construct dams, canals and barrages that would route the Mahadayi waters to the Malaprabha basin and water the parched districts of Bagalkot, Gadag, Dharwad and Belgaum in “Bombay” Karnataka, bordering Maharashtra, to the north-west. \nGoa’s contentions were that its population was dependent on the river’s natural course, diversion would impair the fragile ecosystem and deprive the state of the quantum of required water. Karnataka’s point was since Goa “allowed” the surplus water to flow into the sea, it should be channelled into the deficit Malaprabha basin. \nALSO READ: Battle for Karnataka: What strategy is the Congress working on to beat BJP? \nEventually, the Supreme Court stayed the construction of dams and canals by Karnataka and set up a water dispute tribunal that Goa sought in 2010. Goa accused Karnataka of being a bully. \nThe BJP found itself between a rock and a hard resting place. Soon after the BJP formed a government in Goa in 2017, the party president, Amit Shah, asked Parrikar and Karnataka CM candidate B S Yeddyurappa to “settle” the matter. Parrikar did not meet Yeddyurappa but in deference to Shah’s directive he wrote a missive in which he stated that Goa was willing to release the Mahadayi water as long as it was used only for drinking in the drought-prone areas and not for irrigation. \nAs Yeddyurappa flaunted Parrikar’s letter as a “resolution”, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah asked on whose authority had Yeddyurappa “acted” and whether he was the country’s prime minister. Nothing more was heard of the Mahadayi issue but the BJP leaders and workers of “Bombay” Karnataka have pressured the party to articulate their stand, failing which they may have a hard time answering people’s questions. \nMilestones in Karnataka’s famous riparian discords with neighbouring states \nCauvery River \n* 1974: The agreement signed between Madras Presidency and the princely State of Mysore in 1924 lapses. \n* May 1990: Supreme Court directs Centre to constitute Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal, a demand made by Tamil Nadu since 1970. \n1991 \n* Jan: The CWDT rejects Tamil Nadu government's plea for interim relief.

Send me a copy: \nhttp://mybs.in/2Vm5BEY Congress president Rahul Gandhi during a interaction with pourakarmikas on the last day of his Jana Aashirwada Yatre in Bengaluru | PTI Photo ALSO READ No longer a cakewalk: How the 2019 narrative turned upside down for Modi Modi\'s arrogance can dim BJP\'s chances of repeating 2014 in 2019 elections Modi\'s \'One Nation, One Election\': Death knell for cooperative federalism? Opposition should field common candidates in 2019 polls: Salman Khurshid Sonia dinner: 20 Opposition leaders weigh Modi threat; top 10 developments \nForget the BJP winning the 2019 polls, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi might lose his Varanasi seat under a united opposition, asserted Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday. \nPegging his confidence on opposition unity, Gandhi said far from the BJP winning the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, even Modi might lose from Varanasi if his party, the SP and the BSP were united against him. \nExuding confidence over roping in and managing alliance partners despite their varied personal and regional aspirations, Gandhi predicted for the current ruling dispensation, a "collapse" not "seen in many years.""Frankly, I don\'t see the BJP winning the next election, so in 2019 we will go back to the normal, I sense," he said in reply to a question on "Dalit anger." "...because there are two basic things, once opposition unity goes above a certain level, it becomes impossible to win elections. Now the opposition unity has gone to a point. It\'s simple," Gandhi said at an informal media interaction.\nPointing at the opposition unity efforts in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and by the DMK, the Trinamool Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party in Tamil Nadu, Gandhi asked, "Where are they (BJP) going to win seats?" And in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab. We will take it over.""You are going to see a collapse of the style you haven\'t seen in many years," he said. \nGandhi was on the sixth leg of campaigning as part of the \'Janashirvada Yatra\' ahead of the May 12 polls in Karnataka. \nResponding to a question doubting the forging of opposition unity amid varied aspirations of each party and their leaders, Gandhi expressed confidence of overcoming it. \n"We will manage it. We in the Congress know how to carry people, we are not egotistical people, we don\'t crush people and we don\'t destroy people\'s lives, so we will manage it," he said. \nThe basic thing is how to get the country out of the "mess that Mr Modi and RSS has putit in," he said. \nThe Congress president also ruled out emergence of any third front. \nAccusing the RSS of generating anger and hatred, Gandhi alleged that people are being killed for what they are saying and that needs to be put to an end. \n"The natural sort of political environment where there is a little bit of acrimony, but not hatred, needs to be restored," he said. \nStating that Modi had a "very good" opportunity after the 2014 election, Gandhi said a lot could have been done for the country. \nTerming as "funny" the BJP\'s confidence of breaking the opposition alliance in Uttar Prdesh and claiming that he understands UP politics, Rahul said when the three parties (SP, BSP and Congress) come together, " BJP will win only two seats, that too with luck. \nHe said even Modi may lose if he stands from Varanasi and the three parties were united against him. \n"In fact, I challenge him to stand with three parties united," he added. \nThe BSP and the SP jointly fought Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats during the recent bypolls, costing the BJP both the seats, vacated respectively by Uttar Pradesh chief minister and deputy chief minister. \nHitting out at Modi and the BJP, the Congress president said they have lost track of running the country. \n"You can\'t run this country as an individual, you have to run this country by listening to it, by working with it... and now after four years, he (Modi) has suddenly lost it, because now the wheels are running on them. Everybody can see that, you can hear it in his speeches," he said. \nResponding to a question, Rahul blamed the "mentality" for Modi and BJP losing track. \nHe said, "...it is the mentality... you stand in frontof Basavanna (12th century social reformer from Karnataka) or Ambedkar, praise them, and then you destroy everything that they stood for...""Basavanna is an idea, he is the representative of idea of Karnataka, you can go and stand in front of his statue as much as you want, but it won\'t work if you are destroying the idea... so, it is the mentality..." he said. \nSharing his experience in Gujarat, he said those raising "Modi Modi" slogans were nice to him when he met them and claimed they were "paid" for their sloganeering.

It is quite unfortunate that the violence had led to the death of several people. The day-long agitation has heavily disrupted the educational system, banking and financial sectors, public events of common interests and various emergency services. The fact is that all financial losses are falling onto the shoulders of the public. Meanwhile, political parties and the public need to look for alternate ways to protest on the issues they face. Largely, disrupting the life of the common people is no way to gain any benefits, whereas it tarnishes the sentiments of genuine democratic principles.\nFrom Mr Ramachandran Nair\nOman\nWill the voters end up suffering?\nThere is doubt that the West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) have taken the initiative to topple the Modi Government at the centre. Though initially they were against having an alliance with the Congress, they seem to have changed their mind to seek their support. Of course, the Congress too would be nothing without the support of other Opposition parties. Only time will tell whether all these party leaders, who have different agendas, will get together to form the Coalition Government in 2019. The ultimate sufferers are the voters, who continue to suffer. Let us wait and watch as to whether their efforts are going to be sweet or sour?\nFrom Mr N. Mahadevan\nIndia\nDemocracy trampled underfoot\nWhat’s going on in India is a kind of genocide. It is the destruction of the ancient inhabitants of the country, the Dalit caste. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) inspired massacre of the voiceless Dalits has not so far attracted the attention of the ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP). People were killed by the police in the streets and many more are seriously injured. Prime Minister Narendra Modi owes an explanation to the nation for this mindless massacre. Democracy seems to be faltering and falling to pieces in India, despite being the largest democratic set up in the world.\nFrom Mr Thomas Matthew\nIndia\nThis is a deeper problem\nOff late, the incidents reported about the death of children in the northern states of UP and Bihar of India are alarming (“Two-month-old baby who was denied stretcher dies in hospital”, Gulf News, March 28). The Gorakhpur incident wherein children died owing to lack of adequate oxygen supply, the ghastly treatment of a patient using an amputated limb as a pillow and the recent incident of denying a stretcher to a baby, all point to the gross acts of negligence - all showing the country in a poor light. The videos go viral and social media is the first to pop up the news. It is to be noted that there are several instances where social media has been proved wrong. We do not wait for investigations but jump into conclusions. The political bias of our countrymen and media make us believe everything we see. We have to wait for the investigations and use our commonsense before making any judgments. There was a video of a man carrying the corpse of his dead wife for a long distance and the investigations revealed a lot more. It was not that he was denied an ambulance but he chose to do so for some other reason. It is true that the public hospitals still leave a lot to be desired when it comes to the standards but bizarre and strange incidents do not occur so frequently. Social media should be more responsible and I hope that the upcoming regulations on posting such videos will be helpful in distinguishing the truth from sensationalism.\nFrom Mr Murugesh S.S. Sivam\nDubai\nWhat is mankind coming to?\nWhy are human beings deprived of humanity is a colossal question. Mankind is getting thicker with selfishness, the outcome will be such intense incidents around us. Hospitals are the place for the suffering, and the kind of people who treat and take care of them. But, there are some so called humans with beast like minds who go past all goodness. Stretchers and ambulances are supposed to be provided to the needy, but the daily reports portray another side of the truth, which we don’t want to see.\nFrom Ms Annie Rathi Samuel\nUSA\nShould be ashamed\nI think the recent stories of hospitals neglecting their patients in India is appalling. Whether it is denying someone a stretcher or using someone’s amputated leg as a pillow, how can people be so careless and mean? All these people aren’t fit to be doctors and nurses. Reading such stories in the news only make me wonder at the current state of the world. All these doctors need to be ashamed of themselves.\nFrom Ms Alia Mathur\nDubai\nEditor’s note: Is there a news report that you feel strongly about?

(File) \nNew Delhi: Dubbing the Union government as "anti-Dalit," the Congress on Sunday said its criticism by BJP\'s Dalits lawmakers has exposed it and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to break his "silence" and respond to their concerns.Quoting from the statements five BJP Dalit MPs, Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill claimed that they proved PM Modi was working to make India \'Dalit-mukt.\'The condition of scheduled castes can be understood when even the ruling party\'s MPs were underlining their fear and concerns, he told reporters.Taking a dig at Modi\'s 2014 poll campaign around \'Chai pe charcha\' and his monthly radio broadcast \'Mann ki Baat,\' the Congress spokesperson asked the Prime Minister to engage in a \'charcha\' (discussion) with his own party\'s Dalit MPs to listen to their \'Mann ki Baat\'.He said the situation due to rising atrocities on Dalits amid the government\'s lack of concern and inaction over the malady has reached such an alarming level that even the BJP MPs were now saying that the Modi government has done nothing for the community and that their condition has deteriorated under the government.The prime minister must break his never-ending silence on rising atrocities against Dalits and respond to the concerns and questions of his own MPs. BJP MPs\' statements prove beyond doubt that PM Modi was working towards a Dalit-mukt\' India," Shergill said.BJP MPs have exposed Modi\'s "anti-Dalit" mindset and policies, he added.Taking a dig at the Prime Minister\'s directive to his party MPs to spend a night in a village with over 50 per cent Dalits and tribals population, he said the prime minister should first call his party\'s Dalit MPs to his house to address their concerns rather than doing these "PR stunts".The statements of BJP\'s Dalit MPs– Udit Raj, Savitri Bai Phule, Chhote Lal Kharwar, Ashok Kumar Dohre and Yashwant Singh have punctured the government\'s tall claims, he said.CommentsThese Lok Sabha members have expressed concerns over issues facing Dalits. While some of the MPs like Udit Raj and Dohre have not targeted their party\'s top brass outright others like Singh and Phule have been explicit in their criticism of the government.PM Modi\'s "stoic silence" shows the BJP-RSS is working towards making India Dalit-free and he was "enjoying" the anguish and pain of the scheduled castes and tribes, Mr Shergill alleged.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:23:51.032+03:00', 'uuid': '4d9a0b206d8253e3e1cdf24b6cc6b1f08c3c9815', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T21:49:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Congress Asks PM Modi To Break “Silence”, Respond To Dalit Concerns', 'site': 'pioneernews.in', 'main_image': 'http://www.pioneernews.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pm-narendra-modi_650x400_81522833344.jpg', 'domain_rank': None, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'title': 'Congress Asks PM Modi To Break “Silence”, Respond To Dalit Concerns', 'uuid': '4d9a0b206d8253e3e1cdf24b6cc6b1f08c3c9815', 'site_section': 'http://www.pioneernews.in/feed', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T21:49:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'IN', 'site_full': 'www.pioneernews.in', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9MJKeYW0Emvg4rYQCux0.qAfBpf2gtBoHS5YTQCt7jlYGLkjOr.rkDY8LifybHJyU.MV0M31juju6UvcTzrMJwjyAFoLuMo7phE4MKgOu09Lf.ibFUKoxb', 'section_title': 'Pioneer News'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'new delhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'india', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'dalit', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'mann', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'jaiveer shergill', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'chai', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'congress asks pm modi to break', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'congress', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bjp', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9MJKeYW0Emvg4rYQCux0.qAfBpf2gtBoHS5YTQCt7jlYGLkjOr.rkDY8LifybHJyU.MV0M31juju6UvcTzrMJwjyAFoLuMo7phE4MKgOu09Lf.ibFUKoxb', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': '', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Rahul, Sonia will lose their LS seats in 2019: BJP', 'text': 'Updated: Monday, April 9, 2018, 0:50   \nHitting back at Rahul Gandhi for claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi may lose from Varanasi in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP on Sunday said the Congress president and his mother, Sonia Gandhi, will lose from their respective constituencies due to the people\'s growing "disappointment" with them.

Ramadoss had requested the support of all political parties for the strike.\nThe DMK leader said his party was of the strong view that the united voice of Tamil Nadu in respect of Cauvery river water should be heard by the Centre.\nAs a result, the DMK would extend its support to Wednesday’s shutdown strike, Stalin said. \nA shutdown called by the DMK on April 5 derailed normal life in the state.\nStalin, who is leading the Cauvery Rights Retrieval March, said black flags would be shown to Modi when he comes to inaugurate the DefExpo 2018 near here on April 12.\nSpeaking in a village in Thanjavur district on Sunday, Stalin said apart from showing black flags, people should also wear black shirts on that day and fly black flags atop their houses to show their agony over the Cauvery issue.\nThe Supreme Court on February 16 reduced Tamil Nadu’s share of Cauvery water from 177.25 thousand million cubic feet (TMC), which was less than the 192 TMC allocated by a tribunal in 2007, while Karnataka’s share of water was increased by 14.75 TMC.\nThe court also ordered the central government to set up the Cauvery Management Board within six weeks of its order, but the government failed to do so within the deadline that ended on March 29.\nFollowing this, the DMK and its allies have been holding protests in Tamil Nadu.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:25:08.000+03:00', 'uuid': '0ee8ede8405b517fa779e612a1b4761cb238198c', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T17:33:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'DMK to support PMK-led shutdown on April 11 | GulfNews.com', 'site': 'gulfnews.com', 'main_image': 'https://static.gulfnews.com/media/img/gulfnews_logo.png?v=1', 'domain_rank': 5247, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'DMK to support PMK-led shutdown on April 11', 'uuid': '0ee8ede8405b517fa779e612a1b4761cb238198c', 'site_section': 'http://gulfnews.com/news', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T17:33:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'gulfnews.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.025, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoYa5EQE1i6IfPkjtvPH0Uvs_Z274p8nSqdgga3..MB2H_UJqaYzMBnpObU.t3cspqjAZNTHx5c_ZtEIS1hmaxIVcCggQpcn3P9rCTqZWuooLTXsrzO0JWN', 'section_title': 'Global, Middle East and UAE News by Gulf News'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'chennai', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'cauvery', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'thanjavur', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'tamil nadu', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'm.k. stalin', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'stalin', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 's. ramadoss', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'cauvery management board', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'cauvery water regulatory committee', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'cmb', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'cwrc', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'pmk', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFoYa5EQE1i6IfPkjtvPH0Uvs_Z274p8nSqdgga3..MB2H_UJqaYzMBnpObU.t3cspqjAZNTHx5c_ZtEIS1hmaxIVcCggQpcn3P9rCTqZWuooLTXsrzO0JWN', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'PTI', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'BJP Names 72 Candidates for Karnataka Assembly Elections, Fields Yeddyurappa From Shikaripura', 'text': 'PTI \nUpdated: April 9, 2018, 12:03 AM IST BJP President Amit Shah with State Unit President B S Yeduyurappa during the launch of party’s 75-day ‘Nava Karnataka Nirmana Parivartan Yatra’ in Bengaluru (File photo/PTI) New Delhi: BJP’s chief ministerial candidate for Karnataka, BS Yeddyurappa, will contest from Shikaripura assembly constituency, the party’s Central Election Committee announced on Sunday, as it released a list of 72 candidates for the high-stake contest.\nVeteran state leaders Jagadish Shettar and KS Eswarappa will contest from Hubli Dharwad Central and Shimoga Assembly seats, respectively, it said. \nThe BJP top brass, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah, met earlier tonight to finalise the candidates for the polls. \nSenior party leader JP Nadda released the list of 72 candidates following the committee’s meeting.

They accused Congress chief Rahul Gandhi of fuelling the fire with his “lies and rumor-mongering”. \nThe BJP leaders, however, parried queries on the statements of several Dalit MPs of their party, with Prasad maintaining that the party would talk to them and listen to their concerns. \nViolent protests during a ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by several Dalit groups on April 2 left at least 11 people dead. It brought to fore the grievances of the community and also triggered a war of words between the opposition and the ruling BJP. Gehlot, the most prominent Dalit leader of the BJP, said Dalit icon Bhimrao Ambedkar and BSP founder Kanshi Ram never supported violent protests as he attacked the Congress and the Mayawati-led BSP. \nPrasad accused the two parties besides the Samajwadi Party of abetting violence as part of a conspiracy and said they were politicising the matter to polarise the country. \n“The opposition should not work to divide the country for political interests,” he said. The BJP’s charge was that the matter was being politicised as Prime Minister Narendra Modi came from a poor family and the BJP had largest number of Dalit and tribal MPs and MLAs in its fold. \nPrasad claimed that the maximum violence was seen in those parts of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where the Congress and the BSP had influence. Opposition parties were trying to spread bitterness, casteism and regionalism in the country to target the BJP, he alleged. \nGehlot said the Narendra Modi-led government had strengthened the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with amendments in 2016 and done a lot to celebrate Ambedkar’s legacy, including observing his birth anniversary with year-long events and building memorials in places linked to him. \nCiting Gandhi’s reported comments that the act had been abrogated, Prasad alleged that he was fuelling the fire with his lies. To a question about Gandhi’s planned fast, he said in a June that the Congress leader had a right to do so but should refrain from spreading rumours. \nGehlot said Modi had been able to make his image of a “messiah” for weaker sections of the society, causing heartburn in the opposition. Parties like the Congress and the BSP did nothing for Dalits and at times even worked against their interests, Prasad and Gehlot alleged. \nIt was Mayawati who as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister in 2007 wrote to the state police to stop misuse of the act while the Congress did not accord Bharat Ratna to Ambedkar for decades following his death in 1956, Prasad claimed. \nTaking a dig at the Congress, he said the party had now discovered love for Ambedkar. Citing the government’s work to empower Dalits, Gehlot said the BJP was the only pro-Dalit party.

He is raising questions on the bureacracy, but certainly not on the leadership. The leadership is honest,” he said. \n“The BJP firmly believes in ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas’. Whatever shortcomings are highlighted by Rajbhar, they are being addressed and corrective action is also being taken. It will be better if he raises these issues during Cabinet meetings,” the BJP spokesman said. \nRajbhar had left the saffron party days before the Rajya Sabha biennial elections in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and had threatened that his four MLAs would boycott the voting. \nThe SBSP has four MLAs in the 403-member in the UP Assembly, where the BJP and its allies have a majority of 324 lawmakers. \nAttacking the UP chief minister, Rajbhar said, “Why are MPs and MLAs angry with the (Yogi Adityanath) government? Why are they going to Delhi to convey their grievances? Why are the MLAs angry and are sitting on protests?” \nOn the recent appointments made in the state secondary education board, he said, “The BJP’s slogan of ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas’ is not being implemented in letter and spirit as relatives of senior BJP leaders from upper castes have been appointed.” \n“Now, tell me where will the people from backward castes and scheduled castes go…If I speak, then people start feeling bad,” Rajbhar said. \n“In meetings of the UP Cabinet, everyone’s views are heard, but the decision is taken by a handful of just four to five persons. If we have voted for you, then we should also have a say. Now, if I open my mouth, I am charged with saying harsh things,” he said. \nA sulking Rajbhar had last month rushed to Delhi with his complaint and met the BJP chief. \nHe returned to Lucknow a bit mollified after Shah promised to visit the state capital on April 10 and hear him in detail in the presence of the chief minister. \n“I will tell you what the BJP wants and what Om Prakash Rajbhar wants after April 10,” he said. \n“If he (Shah) does not agree on the issues raised by us, as he had promised (during a meeting in Delhi ahead of the Rajya Sabha polls), we will have to re-think about the alliance,” he said replying to a question. \nThe SBSP leader was also critical of the BJP’s decision not to select the chief minister from among the 325 elected NDA MLAs (one of them later died) in the state. \n“It appears that all of them were worthless,” he said. \nRajbhar had recently claimed that corruption had increased in Uttar Pradesh under the present dispensation and that his party was not getting the due respect from the senior coalition partner. \n“Now their (BJP’s) own MPs and MLAs are speaking against them and sitting on dharna…Look at the statements that are coming from people occupying responsible positions…There has to be something behind their speaking like this,” he said.He was referring to Lok Sabha MPs from Etawah and Nagina, Ashok Kumar Dohrey and Yashwant Singh, respectively, who are the latest to join other Dalit colleagues, who have publicly expressed their unhappiness, especially after the recent protests against the Supreme Court order on the Schedule Castes and Schedule Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. \nEarlier, Robertsganj Lok Sabha MP Chhotelal had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused Adityanath of “scolding” him when he went to take up an issue with him. \nWhile these three Dalit parliamentarians of the BJP have approached Modi with their concerns, Bahraich MP Savitri Bai Phoole has virtually turned a rebel, triggering speculation that she might join the BSP, which she had earlier quit to join the saffron party.

Now the opposition unity has gone to a point. It’s simple,” Gandhi said at an informal media interaction. \nPointing at the opposition unity efforts in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and by the DMK, the Trinamool Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party in Tamil Nadu, Gandhi asked, “Where are they (BJP) going to win seats?” \nAnd in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab. We will take it over.” \n“You are going to see a collapse of the style you haven’t seen in many years,” he said. \nGandhi was on the sixth leg of campaigning as part of the ‘Janashirvada Yatra’ ahead of the May 12 polls in Karnataka. \nResponding to a question doubting the forging of opposition unity amid varied aspirations of each party and their leaders, Gandhi expressed confidence of overcoming it. \n“We will manage it. We in the Congress know how to carry people, we are not egotistical people, we don’t crush people and we don’t destroy people’s lives, so we will manage it,” he said. \nThe basic thing is how to get the country out of the “mess that Mr Modi and RSS has putit in,” he said. \nThe Congress president also ruled out emergence of any third front. \nAccusing the RSS of generating anger and hatred, Gandhi alleged that people are being killed for what they are saying and that needs to be put to an end. \n“The natural sort of political environment where there is a little bit of acrimony, but not hatred, needs to be restored,” he said. \nStating that Modi had a “very good” opportunity after the 2014 election, Gandhi said a lot could have been done for the country. \nTerming as “funny” the BJP’s confidence of breaking the opposition alliance in Uttar Prdesh and claiming that he understands UP politics, Rahul said when the three parties (SP, BSP and Congress) come together, “BJP will win only two seats, that too with luck. \nHe said even Modi may lose if he stands from Varanasi and the three parties were united against him. \n“In fact, I challenge him to stand with three parties united,” he added. \nThe BSP and the SP jointly fought Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats during the recent bypolls, costing the BJP both the seats, vacated respectively by Uttar Pradesh chief minister and deputy chief minister. \nHitting out at Modi and the BJP, the Congress president said they have lost track of running the country. \n“You can’t run this country as an individual, you have to run this country by listening to it, by working with it… and now after four years, he (Modi) has suddenly lost it, because now the wheels are running on them. Everybody can see that, you can hear it in his speeches,” he said. \nResponding to a question, Rahul blamed the “mentality” for Modi and BJP losing track. \nHe said, “…it is the mentality… you stand in front of Basavanna (12th century social reformer from Karnataka) or Ambedkar, praise them, and then you destroy everything that they stood for…” \n“Basavanna is an idea, he is the representative of idea of Karnataka, you can go and stand in front of his statue as much as you want, but it won’t work if you are destroying the idea… so, it is the mentality…” he said. \nSharing his experience in Gujarat, he said those raising “Modi Modi” slogans were nice to him when he met them and claimed they were “paid” for their sloganeering.

PTI | Updated: Apr 09, 2018, 00:17 AM IST Comments | File photo \nMehsana: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday called Prime Minister Narendra Modi an "iron man" for accelerating the pace of development in the country. \nThe "Iron Man" sobriquet is used to describe the first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for his uncompromising commitment to unify the country post-Independence. \nAddressing a gathering of monks in Visnagar town in Mehsana district, Adityanath also equated Modi\'s leadership with that of Mahatma Gandhi and Patel. \n"Immediately after Independence, when Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had visited Saurashtra, he pledged to renovate the Somnath Temple. This pledge could have been taken for other parts of the country as well but it was the effect of Gujarat\'s soil... It\'s a holy land that gave leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to the country in difficult times. \n"And today, the country is similarly surging rapidly ahead under the leadership of iron man Narendra Modiji to reach the top of the world, something which we had never dreamt before," he said. \nAdityanath, the chief abbot of Gorakhnath Mutt in Uttar Pradesh, was in Visnagar to attend a religious programme of the Nath sect. He previosuly visited the town in December 2016 following the death of Mahant Gulabnath. \nAdityanath\'s Gujarat counterpart Vijay Rupani said the Somnath Temple would not have been vandalised by foreign invaders had the country not been divided along caste lines. \nHe said casteism and untouchability kept India divided. \n"There is a need to launch a fight against this. I appeal to you seers to take a pledge to save the religion... Modiji is working on to take the country to newer heights," he said. \nAdityanath invited the seers present there to attend the 2019 Kumbh Mela, to be held in Uttar Pradesh. \nHe said Modi\'s "Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas" slogan is a spinoff of the Sanatan Dharma philosophy, which also calls for taking everybody along. \n"It is the first time that we will take a pledge and frame a policy that an Indian, whatever community he belongs to, will get shelter. And today, every poor is getting a roof on his head, getting food, electricity etc. Development has reached remote corners," the UP chief minister said. \nHe hailed Modi for being instrumental in getting UNESCO recognition for Yoga and Kumbh festival.

The drive to attain the label of ‘world-class institution’ is becoming stronger by the day, particularly as a credibility measure, considering the relatively poor image of Indian institutions in the international arena. The active presence of international accreditation agencies in India is an indication of this. Addressing the centenary celebrations at the Patna University last year, PM Narendra Modi had said it is a blot that no Indian university figures among the top few in the world, while in the past universities such as Nalanda and Taxila attracted students from across the globe. In line with this, to ensure ‘greater excellence and innovation’ in higher education, the government had announced a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore for five years to 10 private and 10 government universities to be chosen by the government. Further, these 20 institutions would be free from the constraints of government rules and regulations in order to facilitate them to emerge as world-class institutions. While this initiative is welcome, the exclusive pursuit of status and ranks by a few chosen universities, rather than by all institutions who meet a certain milestone to become the ‘chosen one’, may not be able to achieve the objective. The desire and ability of institutions who wish to push their frontiers to achieve this must be given a chance.\nThe identification of these ‘chosen ones’ who may not want government funding but they, for sure, would want full autonomy must be on an auto mode, i.e. milestone-based, to increase the prospect of success from India perspective. The Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business (ISB) getting one of the top global ranks in a recent Financial Times ranking is a case in point. The ISB is not governed by any Indian academic regulator and does not take government funds. It is not appropriate for a country like India to invest a huge amount of taxpayer money to fund the effort of only a few universities to attain global rankings, precluding others who also may have intent. All options to make fund utilisation optimal must be explored. For example, to encourage fund flow into higher education—a non-profit activity—the government may do well to incentivise private fund flow through tax exemption. This would ensure, at current corporate tax rates, three times the tax forgone by the government into higher education. If the government forgoes Rs 2,000 crore as tax revenue adjusted against the corpus, then about Rs 6,000 crore can flow into higher education from private sources.\nAdd this to the Rs 10,000 crore fund outlay, and the total fund mobilised would be Rs 14,000 crore. To further strengthen fund flow, the mandatory corporate CSR activity can be aligned with higher education in line with the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 2016. Such a redefinition will broaden the scope of institutions wanting to push their boundaries and, thus, improve the chance of success in meeting the objectives. The fund allocation in its current form appears inefficient and of skewed priority. It must also be understood that the bygone era Nalanda and Taxila universities received grants from the kings and thereafter the kings neither asked questions on fund utilisation nor were there any audits. These universities did with funds what they considered the best. In the current Indian context, the impact of questions that may be asked by government agencies on fund utilisation by private universities, in particular, can be a matter of a debate. Milestone-based parity in raising or utilisation of funds, autonomy, competition and government monitoring in equal measure for all educational institutions must be the only way to fast-track higher education reform in India.\n ', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:50:22.032+03:00', 'uuid': '05d7a64fe93e05edbeb2dc31d96f7dd00bc4811a', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-09T08:02:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Why it is important to fast-track higher education reform - The Financial Express', 'site': 'financialexpress.com', 'main_image': 'http://images.financialexpress.com/2018/04/education-1.jpg', 'domain_rank': 4726, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'Why it is important to fast-track higher education reform', 'uuid': '05d7a64fe93e05edbeb2dc31d96f7dd00bc4811a', 'site_section': 'http://www.financialexpress.com/', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 22, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 22}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-09T08:02:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'www.financialexpress.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.986, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5uiXiHvlQKyz0H0EVBce9J2RlmVmDVYleej0KOoRwF.tCNrjJN__rbh.b_fPKPa35DDKTnqOGL7m66TKyZXUcxkMciSUQGR10LkIhCN5oQzgQ--', 'section_title': 'Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines - The Financial Express'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'taxila', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'india', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'nalanda', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'patna university', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5uiXiHvlQKyz0H0EVBce9J2RlmVmDVYleej0KOoRwF.tCNrjJN__rbh.b_fPKPa35DDKTnqOGL7m66TKyZXUcxkMciSUQGR10LkIhCN5oQzgQ--', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': '', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Nepal’s Oli | Orissa Post', 'text': '14 VIEWS \nNepal’s relations with India have not been seeing the best of times. This has been so ever since the exit of King Birendra, the ‘benevolent’ king who maintained very close and brotherly relations with its southern neighbour. Birendra’s assassination in a palace intrigue and the ascension to the throne by his brother King Gyanendra, followed by political turbulence, led to the process of democracy gaining strength there. A new Constitution is in place, followed by a new government in February last after polls gave the near-total support for a rainbow coalition headed by Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli. It is with this high public approval ratings and increased clout that Prime Minister Oli visited India in the last three days and held bilateral discussions. Curiously, nothing much seems to have come out of this visit, evident from the fact that no bilateral agreement has been signed.It is well-known that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the RSS had reservations about the way a secular Constitution was being framed by Nepal. In the past, Nepal had been a Hindoo nation. Oli’s special interest to promote ties with China, his criticism of India in sharp terms over what he sees as “interference” in Nepal’s affairs by New Delhi were not viewed favourably by India. The Madhesi stir in the plains close to the Indian border in 2015 in protest against alleged step-motherly treatment to Indian origin people in Nepal, was one pretext which the Modi government utilised to throttle the bulk of the Nepalese population. Notable also is the economic blockade by India to support the Madhesis, cutting off essentials from India to Nepal at the height of the stir, which troubled Nepal in harsh ways. The April 2015 earthquake was also a period when Indian outreach there for help was perceived in critical terms due to the way segments of Indian volunteers and media behaved.Worse, Oli believed that he was overthrown from power in 2016 with some diplomatic manoeuvring by India.It is against this background that Oli chose to visit India a month after he took over office this time. It shows Oli understands the importance of keeping up his country’s relations with India, but he also appears to be firm that Nepal’s growing association with China is the need of the hour for the land-locked Himalayan nation. China is cleverly cultivating Nepal through steady strengthening of bilateral relations.It has roped Nepal in to the One Belt One Road (OBOR) project even as India has refused to be part of it. New dams are proposed to be built with Chinese help in Nepal, a land that has an abundance of waterfalls, while India was caught napping. India says that, in such an event, it would not buy power from such projects — which are essentially meant to run on commercial basis for sale of electricity.Niceties do not mean much in the relations between Nepal and India. Signals emanating from the bilateral talks in Delhi this past weekend are that Nepal might no more be a dependable ally. The big win for Oli’s coalition in the last polls showed that people are firmly behind his dispensation. Not only that, Oli stood against India when the Modi government, with some unreal perceptions, choked essential supplies such as petroleum, medicines and food stuff to the Himalayan country. That was the beginning of the souring of relations between the two nations which were the greatest of friends till recent times. A leftist for life, Oli has been forced to look for other allies after people in Nepal were left high and dry and turned anti India. Keeping his people’s sentiments in mind, Oli took his country closer to China for sheer logistical and economic benefits. Geopolitical realities are such that no nation in the region can afford to ignore the Chinese olive branches. Yet, Nepal had withstood China and favoured India for far too long. The change in attitude occurred only after the Nepalese people perceived the ill intentions and big brotherly behaviour of India. Similarly, Maldives has developed cold feet over its ties with India and Pakistan is helping it edge closer to China. Sri Lanka has been in the Chinese orbit for long; though there are problems of late between the two nations over hefty loans China had offered to the island country. Myanmar already has close ties with China. Even Bangladesh is being wooed by China with economic support. The China-Pakistan axis is a real threat to weak-kneed India.Under the circumstances, India is increasingly getting isolated from others in the region. A natural tendency on the part of nations as also individuals is to ally with the strong entities in a neighbourhood. China today has an economy five times the size of India; and it has grown by leaps and bounds in the past two decades in military might too. For India to thrive and have friends, it is imperative that it strengthens its economic and military clout in much faster ways. Not only that, the Indian foreign policy has become a joke among all neighbouring nations. Bereft of any proper guidelines and with the present Prime minister Modi believing that he, as a solitary operator, can browbeat every other nation because of his towering personality, has cost India dearly. Nepal is just a warning signal about this situation.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:51:24.001+03:00', 'uuid': '5a43bf287ee5baa419e2732277bc66a2f2748c6b', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T22:11:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Nepal’s Oli | Orissa Post', 'site': 'orissapost.com', 'main_image': 'http://www.orissapost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/OLI.jpg', 'domain_rank': None, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'Nepal’s Oli | Orissa Post', 'uuid': '5a43bf287ee5baa419e2732277bc66a2f2748c6b', 'site_section': '', 'participants_count': 0, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T22:11:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'www.orissapost.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.174, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YH.NLwbf3vbbX2AaCahoN1jq5k19qedAKRzCZoWsa8Q--', 'section_title': ''}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'nepal', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'india', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'khadga prasad sharma oli', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'birendra', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'oli', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'king gyanendra', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'orissa post', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YH.NLwbf3vbbX2AaCahoN1jq5k19qedAKRzCZoWsa8Q--', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'FE Online', 'external_links': ['https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress', 'https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress'], 'title': '7th Pay Commission: Will Narendra Modi government accept salary beyond recommendations before 2019 elections?', 'text': '7th Pay Commission latest news today 2018: The government increase salary before 2019 elections. 7th Pay Commission: Even as the Narendra Modi government at the Centre has officially said it is not considering a hike in minimum pay beyond the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, recent reports in the media claim the contrary. In a written reply to the Rajya Sabha in March, Union Minister of State for Finance P Radhakrishnan had said that the Centre was not considering any “change”.\nThe minister said this while asserting that the minimum pay hike of Rs 18,000 per month and the fitment factor of 2.57 were based on “specific recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission” that took “relevant factors” into account while making the salary suggestions for lakhs of Central government employees.\nHowever, some reports now say the Modi government may accept the demand of increasing the minimum pay beyond the recommendation of the 7th Pay Commission and also the retirement age of Central government staff. The Centre may do this in a bid to woo voters ahead of the 2019 General Elections. The Sen Times reported a senior government official as saying on April 4 that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre was mulling to implement the salary-hike for Central government staff ahead of 2019 elections.\nNot just the pay-hike, the Centre may also increase the retirement age from 60 to 62, following in the footsteps of the Madhya Pradesh government. Thus benefitting over 50 lakh Ventral government staff.\nThe Centre may be inspired by a recent move of the Madhya Pradesh government, which increased the retirement age of state government staff from 60 to 62 years, the report said quoting the official.\nThe move, if approved, will serve as a pre-poll sop from the BJP , which now rules in 20 states of the country along with allies. The Centre may also be in a position to direct the NDA-ruled states in the country to increase salary and retirement age of government employees. However, in the absence of an official word, all these are mere speculations.\n ', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:53:50.093+03:00', 'uuid': '51f282a20d6543e6011b694a31ba36c2d3657a02', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T23:02:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': '7th Pay Commission: Will Narendra Modi government accept salary beyond recommendations before 2019 elections? - The Financial Express', 'site': 'financialexpress.com', 'main_image': 'http://images.financialexpress.com/2018/03/648200-money-reuters.jpg', 'domain_rank': 4726, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': '7th Pay Commission: Will Narendra Modi government accept salary beyond recommendations before 2019 elections?', 'uuid': '51f282a20d6543e6011b694a31ba36c2d3657a02', 'site_section': 'http://www.financialexpress.com/', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 226, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 226}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T23:02:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'www.financialexpress.com', 'performance_score': 2, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.009, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tCR2JWA3b8UcK6ZQBHmOn9Cu1EBxeaDGE2lvbXxZrY0mGPgTQWF59Ioo6Y2tx2MO3bjmBi2OHWPBM_JlUAzJRvnHIGqNd8MGtQN9gjOMu_10Fmhtw959TKyMVuw3ZO8mcpBk3VXvYRbhnvZahyIRkrEXYslk62njqaJsJvTlRaoQ--', 'section_title': 'Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines - The Financial Express'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'rajya sabha', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'will narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'radhakrishnan', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': '7th pay commission', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'pay commission', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tCR2JWA3b8UcK6ZQBHmOn9Cu1EBxeaDGE2lvbXxZrY0mGPgTQWF59Ioo6Y2tx2MO3bjmBi2OHWPBM_JlUAzJRvnHIGqNd8MGtQN9gjOMu_10Fmhtw959TKyMVuw3ZO8mcpBk3VXvYRbhnvZahyIRkrEXYslk62njqaJsJvTlRaoQ--', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'PTI', 'external_links': ['https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress', 'https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress'], 'title': 'BJP accuses opposition of abetting violence on Dalit issues', 'text': 'The BJP today claimed that it was the only “pro-Dalit” party and accused opposition parties, including the Congress and the BSP, of abetting violence over issues concerning the community as part of a conspiracy to vitiate the atmosphere. The BJP today claimed that it was the only “pro-Dalit” party and accused opposition parties, including the Congress and the BSP, of abetting violence over issues concerning the community as part of a conspiracy to vitiate the atmosphere. The BJP fielded Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Thawarchand Gehlot to launch a counter attack on opposition parties, which have targeted the saffron party over Dalit issues. They accused Congress chief Rahul Gandhi of fuelling the fire with his “lies and rumour-mongering”.\nThe BJP leaders, however, parried queries on the statements of several Dalit MPs of their party, with Prasad maintaining that the party would talk to them and listen to their concerns. Violent protests during a ‘Bharat Bandh’ called by several Dalit groups on April 2 left at least 11 people dead. It brought to fore the grievances of the community and also triggered a war of words between the opposition and the ruling BJP.\nGehlot, the most prominent Dalit leader of the BJP, said Dalit icon Bhimrao Ambedkar and BSP founder Kanshi Ram never supported violent protests as he attacked the Congress and the Mayawati-led BSP. Prasad accused the two parties besides the Samajwadi Party of abetting violence as part of a conspiracy and said they were politicising the matter to polarise the country. “The opposition should not work to divide the country for political interests,” he said.\nThe BJP’s charge was that the matter was being politicised as Prime Minister Narendra Modi came from a poor family and the BJP had largest number of Dalit and tribal MPs and MLAs in its fold. Prasad claimed that the maximum violence was seen in those parts of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where the Congress and the BSP had influence. Opposition parties were trying to spread bitterness, casteism and regionalism in the country to target the BJP, he alleged.\nGehlot said the Narendra Modi-led government had strengthened the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with amendments in 2016 and done a lot to celebrate Ambedkar’s legacy, including observing his birth anniversary with year-long events and building memorials in places linked to him. Citing Gandhi’s reported comments that the act had been abrogated, Prasad alleged that he was fuelling the fire with his lies. To a question about Gandhi’s planned fast, he said in a June that the Congress leader had a right to do so but should refrain from spreading rumours.\nGehlot said Modi had been able to make his image of a “messiah” for weaker sections of the society, causing heartburn in the opposition. Parties like the Congress and the BSP did nothing for Dalits and at times even worked against their interests, Prasad and Gehlot alleged. It was Mayawati who as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister in 2007 wrote to the state police to stop misuse of the act while the Congress did not accord Bharat Ratna to Ambedkar for decades following his death in 1956, Prasad claimed.\nTaking a dig at the Congress, he said the party had now discovered love for Ambedkar. Citing the government’s work to empower Dalits, Gehlot said the BJP was the only pro-Dalit party.\n ', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:54:25.007+03:00', 'uuid': 'dfe8d0bf2832b55a9df53a822c82eb60280a831f', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-09T04:57:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'BJP accuses opposition of abetting violence on Dalit issues - The Financial Express', 'site': 'financialexpress.com', 'main_image': 'http://images.financialexpress.com/2018/04/bjp-pti-1.jpg', 'domain_rank': 4726, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'BJP accuses opposition of abetting violence on Dalit issues', 'uuid': 'dfe8d0bf2832b55a9df53a822c82eb60280a831f', 'site_section': 'http://www.financialexpress.com/', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 37, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 37}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-09T04:57:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'www.financialexpress.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.049, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tJ.SrPIjSIGuaamaM7kAnby4uJ0AOji7dvmiT8K9kiwTkcvPzobCEK3SwOzIObKunkLmpExepO9ghcrnY3mJAP2FsjmnA5ixAl3Bqxt6l2xg--', 'section_title': 'Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines - The Financial Express'}, 'entities': {'locations': [], 'persons': [{'name': 'prasad', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'rahul gandhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'ravi shankar prasad', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'bjp', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'congress', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bsp', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'union', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tJ.SrPIjSIGuaamaM7kAnby4uJ0AOji7dvmiT8K9kiwTkcvPzobCEK3SwOzIObKunkLmpExepO9ghcrnY3mJAP2FsjmnA5ixAl3Bqxt6l2xg--', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'PTI', 'external_links': ['https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress', 'https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress'], 'title': "PM Narendra Modi turns down Piyush Goyal's plan to turn CST into museum: Sources", 'text': 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned down Railway Minister Piyush Goyal’s ambitious plan to convert Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus into one of the first museum-cum-railway stations in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has turned down Railway Minister Piyush Goyal’s ambitious plan to convert Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus into one of the first museum-cum-railway stations in India, ministry sources said.\nThe terminal was built over 10 years, starting in 1878. It was designed on the late medieval Italian models and it was elevated to the status of a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2004.\nGoyal had announced to convert the busy terminal into a “world-class museum” during his visit there in November.\nDuring a meeting attended by Goyal and senior Railway Board members on March 26, Prime Minister Modi questioned the logic behind such ambitious projects, the sources said.\nThey said the Railway Board was also against Goyal’s museum proposal, which could displace a lot of employees and it would be difficult to accommodate them somewhere else.\nRailway zones, too, had objected to it.\nThe prime minister is understood to have remarked on the lack of railway artifacts that could be showcased in the proposed museum, which, the sources said, were not enough.\nThe bids for the Rs 250-million project was invited by Railway’s subsidiary RITES, which likely received response from top architectural conservation and building restoration firms.\nAt least 13 companies have submitted expressions of interest to design the two floors of the terminal into a museum complex, the sources say.\nThey indicated that the prime minister has also cast a shadow on Goyal’s ambitious electrification plan and his efforts to modernise the train signalling system by bringing in an European model – both of which are now likely put on hold.\nMoreover, Goyal wanted the Railways to hire more safai karmacharis but has been asked to make do with the existing staff, the sources said.\nAll the PMO’s objections, they said, have now been published as minutes of the meeting and thus documented.\n“During the meeting, the ministry was asked to concentrate on projects that are implementable.

Here's why including entrepreneurship development in academic curriculum is important", 'text': 'Unemployment is on the rise in India. One reason is the lack of understanding about market requirements among young people on the threshold of a new career. Education cannot prevent unemployment. Unemployment is on the rise in India. One reason is the lack of understanding about market requirements among young people on the threshold of a new career. Education cannot prevent unemployment. A large number of graduates are unable to find jobs because our universities fail to promote the innovative and entrepreneurial attitude necessary today, not just for entrepreneurs, but also for employees. Even as graduates after graduates pass out of universities, their lack of requisite skills stands in the way of getting a break. They have a degree, but not a job.\nGrowing disconnect\nAt the root of the problem is the disconnect between university education and the requirements of the economy and society. Most academic courses are heavily theory-oriented with hardly any practical component. Add to this the infirmities in planning and implementation of economic development and the lack of focused approach to training human resources for specialised jobs, and we have the recipe for mounting unemployment. So despite PM Narendra Modi ’s exhortations of Make-in-India, our graduates are always looking for jobs (mostly unsuccessfully) and not able to create any.\nInculcating entrepreneurship\nThe fast-changing economic environment is creating new challenges. Entrepreneurship is becoming a priority on the national agenda in most developing countries. It serves as an engine for growth, employment and wealth generation. The need to develop entrepreneurial skills to create new businesses, use unused capacities and develop new capabilities to solve economic and social problems cannot be overemphasised. It allows people, using expertise and ingenuity, to create opportunities and and generate employment and income. Entrepreneurship training can be done in different ways and by various methods, but is most effective if it is included as part of university curriculum.\nSystematic and goal-oriented\nIntroducing entrepreneurship education in the curriculum requires planning and research. It has to be a systematic and goal-oriented process. The objective should be to introduce students to the concept of entrepreneurship and to develop skills in those who show potential. This would entail increasing students’ knowledge about entrepreneurial career and helping them understand the process of setting up and managing a new business; increasing their knowledge of potential businesses and start-ups; improving their ability to be self-employed; and providing an understanding of the role of new enterprises in the economy. But, above all, it would involve instilling in them the spirit of taking risks, embracing change. Entrepreneurship education has the potential to build skills and competencies, and a good teacher can inculcate such skills, knowledge and attitude in students.\nInnovative techniques\nWe need to devise modern teaching techniques to build students’ capabilities through problem-based learning, industry apprenticeship and proper funding. Appropriate teaching methodologies and relevant learning processes must be identified and adopted. Teachers must be well-trained and motivated to promote an entrepreneurial attitude among students. Institutions could tie-up with industries to develop the entrepreneurial component in the curriculum. A joint effort will be mutually beneficial. It can ensure that students inclined towards entrepreneurship are identified and groomed.

Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman today said the DefExpo starting here next week would be a platform for various companies, including micro, small and medium enterprises, to showcase products at the global level. The four-day DefExpo is scheduled to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 12.\n“This Exposition is being conducted in India every two years. This year we are conducting it in Tamil Nadu (Chennai). Various foreign delegates at the Ministerial level will be taking part in it”, she said. “Big companies, small companies, even micro, small and medium enterprises are participating in the event, which will give them an opportunity to show their manufacturing capabilities to various countries”, she said.\nThe minister was speaking to reporters after witnessing a dry run of Land, Naval and Aero defence systems at Thiruvadanthai, about 40 km from here, where the DefExpo will be held. Sitharaman said the Defence Ministry has given 50 per cent concession in booking stalls to MSMEs and added that indigenously manufactured helicopters, tanks and minesweepers would be showcased at the event.\nThe DefExpo would also give an opportunity to companies already exporting defence components to expand their business, she said. Asked whether an invitation was sent to China to take part in the exposition, she said there was enough time to confirm their participation. An exhibition of weapons and military hardware, ‘Defence Expo’ will project India’s defence manufacturing capabilities and showcase its potential to be a major exporter of military platforms.\nIndigenously developed military helicopters, aircraft, missiles and rockets, capabilities to manufacture submarines, frigates and corvettes would be showcased at the event. More than 50 countries have confirmed their participation in the Expo. Defence Production Secretary Ajay Kumar said the event was one of the biggest organised anywhere in the world. “A total of 701 exhibitors have confirmed their participation, making it the highest ever registered.\nNearly 72 per cent of Indian exhibitors have booked stalls for showcasing their products”, he said. “This is the largest DefExpo we are conducting on a 2.90 lakh square feet, which is nearly 25 per cent higher than the previous edition”, he said.\n ', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:56:15.016+03:00', 'uuid': 'd46a0c5e6a40bccd84cb313f5e7e42f27d1e95e2', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-09T04:17:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': "'DefExpo platform for companies to showcase products at global level': Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman - The Financial Express", 'site': 'financialexpress.com', 'main_image': 'http://images.financialexpress.com/2018/04/def-expo-759-1.jpg', 'domain_rank': 4726, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': "'DefExpo platform for companies to showcase products at global level': Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman", 'uuid': 'd46a0c5e6a40bccd84cb313f5e7e42f27d1e95e2', 'site_section': 'http://www.financialexpress.com/', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 134, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 134}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-09T04:17:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'www.financialexpress.com', 'performance_score': 1, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5sudtmHjfZPEEGACvewzr.047RS3H8iDXodEM0MQnhaPgLTZkEZ5qjuV6EToIkIvv_5H4t6.zEepYz.5Kzwkt1j4ZPgbDzsUruhgUE.GmrM7dVcWd.CsdKMqu4V92OcH_t0bi1BKwSpPqpHF7BEqqP6VnmGu9rBzak-', 'section_title': 'Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines - The Financial Express'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'chennai', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'thiruvadanthai', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'tamil nadu', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'india', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'nirmala sitharaman', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'sitharaman', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'naval', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'defence ministry', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'aero', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5sudtmHjfZPEEGACvewzr.047RS3H8iDXodEM0MQnhaPgLTZkEZ5qjuV6EToIkIvv_5H4t6.zEepYz.5Kzwkt1j4ZPgbDzsUruhgUE.GmrM7dVcWd.CsdKMqu4V92OcH_t0bi1BKwSpPqpHF7BEqqP6VnmGu9rBzak-', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'PTI', 'external_links': ['https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress', 'https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress'], 'title': "UP CM Yogi Adityanath calls PM Modi 'iron man' for fast-tracking development", 'text': 'Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today called Prime Minister Narendra Modi an “iron man” for accelerating the pace of development in the country. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today called Prime Minister Narendra Modi an “iron man” for accelerating the pace of development in the country. The “Iron Man” sobriquet is used to describe the first Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel for his uncompromising commitment to unify the country post-Independence. Addressing a gathering of monks in Visnagar town in Mehsana district, Adityanath also equated Modi’s leadership with that of Mahatma Gandhi and Patel.\n“Immediately after Independence, when Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel had visited Saurashtra, he pledged to renovate the Somnath Temple. This pledge could have been taken for other parts of the country as well but it was the effect of Gujarat’s soil… It’s a holy land that gave leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Iron Man Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel to the country in difficult times.\n“And today, the country is similarly surging rapidly ahead under the leadership of iron man Narendra Modiji to reach the top of the world, something which we had never dreamt before,” he said. Adityanath, the chief abbot of Gorakhnath Mutt in Uttar Pradesh, was in Visnagar to attend a religious programme of the Nath sect. He previosuly visited the town in December 2016 following the death of Mahant Gulabnath.\nAdityanath’s Gujarat counterpart Vijay Rupani said the Somnath Temple would not have been vandalised by foreign invaders had the country not been divided along caste lines. He said casteism and untouchability kept India divided. “There is a need to launch a fight against this. I appeal to you seers to take a pledge to save the religion… Modiji is working on to take the country to newer heights,” he said. Adityanath invited the seers present there to attend the 2019 Kumbh Mela, to be held in Uttar Pradesh.\nHe said Modi’s “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas” slogan is a spinoff of the Sanatan Dharma philosophy, which also calls for taking everybody along. “It is the first time that we will take a pledge and frame a policy that an Indian, whatever community he belongs to, will get shelter. And today, every poor is getting a roof on his head, getting food, electricity etc. Development has reached remote corners,” the UP chief minister said. He hailed Modi for being instrumental in getting UNESCO recognition for Yoga and Kumbh festival.\n ', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:58:06.003+03:00', 'uuid': '63878c6e2aee2108629e64c143ae1157ccb59fab', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-09T05:47:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': "UP CM Yogi Adityanath calls PM Modi 'iron man' for fast-tracking development - The Financial Express", 'site': 'financialexpress.com', 'main_image': 'http://images.financialexpress.com/2018/04/yogi-aditya-nath-narendra-modi-pti.jpg', 'domain_rank': 4726, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': "UP CM Yogi Adityanath calls PM Modi 'iron man' for fast-tracking development", 'uuid': '63878c6e2aee2108629e64c143ae1157ccb59fab', 'site_section': 'http://www.financialexpress.com/', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-09T05:47:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'www.financialexpress.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tJ.SrPIjSIGquF12E8EasM4.McsGHuWYazq07nxcfm6EmpqiRgvqsvga_fmtECwi4R3lmTcnFgKMfqu9yFuGNRoZ.biIvEDHy5oS7B7RPaB8HfXJZF_x38pm_gO1Dn2OY-', 'section_title': 'Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines - The Financial Express'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'saurashtra', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'somnath temple', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'gujarat', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'visnagar', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'mehsana', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'yogi adityanath', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'mahatma gandhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'adityanath', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'iron man sardar vallabhbhai patel', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'sardar vallabhbhai patel', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'patel', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': []}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tJ.SrPIjSIGquF12E8EasM4.McsGHuWYazq07nxcfm6EmpqiRgvqsvga_fmtECwi4R3lmTcnFgKMfqu9yFuGNRoZ.biIvEDHy5oS7B7RPaB8HfXJZF_x38pm_gO1Dn2OY-', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'PTI', 'external_links': ['https://twitter.com/FinancialXpress', 'https://www.facebook.com/thefinancialexpress'], 'title': 'Narendra Modi will lose Varanasi in 2019 if this happens, says Rahul Gandhi', 'text': 'Forget the BJP winning the 2019 polls, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi might lose his Varanasi seat under a united opposition, asserted Congress president Rahul Gandhi today. Forget the BJP winning the 2019 polls, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi might lose his Varanasi seat under a united opposition, asserted Congress president Rahul Gandhi today. Pegging his confidence on opposition unity, Gandhi said far from the BJP winning the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, even Modi might lose from Varanasi if his party, the SP and the BSP were united against him. Exuding confidence over roping in and managing alliance partners despite their varied personal and regional aspirations, Gandhi predicted for the current ruling dispensation, a “collapse” not “seen in many years.” “Frankly, I don’t see the BJP winning the next election, so in 2019 we will go back to the normal, I sense,” he said in reply to a question on “Dalit anger.” “…because there are two basic things, once opposition unity goes above a certain level, it becomes impossible to win elections.\nNow the opposition unity has gone to a point. It’s simple,” Gandhi said at an informal media interaction. Pointing at the opposition unity efforts in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and by the DMK, the Trinamool Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party in Tamil Nadu, Gandhi asked, “Where are they (BJP) going to win seats?” And in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab. We will take it over.” “You are going to see a collapse of the style you haven’t seen in many years,” he said. Gandhi was on the sixth leg of campaigning as part of the ‘Janashirvada Yatra’ ahead of the May 12 polls in Karnataka.\nResponding to a question doubting the forging of opposition unity amid varied aspirations of each party and their leaders, Gandhi expressed confidence of overcoming it. “We will manage it. We in the Congress know how to carry people, we are not egotistical people, we don’t crush people and we don’t destroy people’s lives, so we will manage it,” he said. The basic thing is how to get the country out of the “mess that Mr Modi and RSS has put it in,” he said. The Congress president also ruled out emergence of any third front. Accusing the RSS of generating anger and hatred, Gandhi alleged that people are being killed for what they are saying and that needs to be put to an end. “The natural sort of political environment where there is a little bit of acrimony, but not hatred, needs to be restored,” he said.\nStating that Modi had a “very good” opportunity after the 2014 election, Gandhi said a lot could have been done for the country. Terming as “funny” the BJP’s confidence of breaking the opposition alliance in Uttar Prdesh and claiming that he understands UP politics, Rahul said when the three parties (SP, BSP and Congress) come together, “BJP will win only two seats, that too with luck. He said even Modi may lose if he stands from Varanasi and the three parties were united against him. “In fact, I challenge him to stand with three parties united,” he added. The BSP and the SP jointly fought Gorakhpur and Phulpur Lok Sabha seats during the recent bypolls, costing the BJP both the seats, vacated respectively by Uttar Pradesh chief minister and deputy chief minister.\nHitting out at Modi and the BJP, the Congress president said they have lost track of running the country. “You can’t run this country as an individual, you have to run this country by listening to it, by working with it… and now after four years, he (Modi) has suddenly lost it, because now the wheels are running on them. Everybody can see that, you can hear it in his speeches,” he said. Responding to a question, Rahul blamed the “mentality” for Modi and BJP losing track. He said, “…it is the mentality… you stand in front of Basavanna (12th century social reformer from Karnataka) or Ambedkar, praise them, and then you destroy everything that they stood for…”\n“Basavanna is an idea, he is the representative of idea of Karnataka, you can go and stand in front of his statue as much as you want, but it won’t work if you are destroying the idea… so, it is the mentality…” he said. Sharing his experience in Gujarat, he said those raising “Modi Modi” slogans were nice to him when he met them and claimed they were “paid” for their sloganeering.\n ', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T22:59:14.019+03:00', 'uuid': '7cb5e8425d1f5159928952ee6d9612a96ac378af', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-09T01:45:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Narendra Modi will lose Varanasi in 2019 if this happens, says Rahul Gandhi - The Financial Express', 'site': 'financialexpress.com', 'main_image': 'http://images.financialexpress.com/2018/04/modi-l-1-2-1-1.jpg', 'domain_rank': 4726, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'Narendra Modi will lose Varanasi in 2019 if this happens, says Rahul Gandhi', 'uuid': '7cb5e8425d1f5159928952ee6d9612a96ac378af', 'site_section': 'http://www.financialexpress.com/', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 1, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 1}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-09T01:45:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'US', 'site_full': 'www.financialexpress.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tJ.SrPIjSIGl9ffMi26VGzpXg.KTF6WV8HFF7oxyTRhG6UmN.zX3Cu.SDCrMwkg0NhYcY51H9LaUw91r0X_UNRtWf5umczxCUGDFPXdTahh3JZv5w5aANSgJuIR4Te1n4-', 'section_title': 'Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines - The Financial Express'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'varanasi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'varanasi sea', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'rahul gandhi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'gandhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'bjp', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'congress', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bsp', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tJ.SrPIjSIGl9ffMi26VGzpXg.KTF6WV8HFF7oxyTRhG6UmN.zX3Cu.SDCrMwkg0NhYcY51H9LaUw91r0X_UNRtWf5umczxCUGDFPXdTahh3JZv5w5aANSgJuIR4Te1n4-', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'Agencies', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'United opposition will defeat BJP, Modi in 2019: Rahul Gandhi', 'text': 'Politics | By Agencies United opposition will defeat BJP, Modi in 2019: Rahul Gandhi \nBengaluru: An upbeat Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asserted that a united opposition would defeat the BJP, as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi from Varanasi, in the 2019 general elections.

Another senior Shiv Sena leader, Maharashtra industry minister Subhash Desai, addressing Sena cadres in Navi Mumbai on Saturday, said the BJP’s “tone and language” had changed after setbacks in recent bypolls. Photo: HT Mumbai: Just a day after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah expressed his hope that the Shiv Sena will stay with the BJP for the next elections, two prominent Sena leaders on Saturday rebuffed the overture. \nShiv Sena member of Parliament (MP) Sanjay Raut told reporters on Saturday that “the time to formalize an alliance for the elections had long passed”. Raut reiterated the Sena’s decision to fight the next elections on its own, as announced by party chief Uddhav Thakeray on 23 January. \nAnother senior Shiv Sena leader, Maharashtra industry minister Subhash Desai, addressing Sena cadres in Navi Mumbai on Saturday, said the BJP’s “tone and language” had changed after setbacks in recent bypolls. “Amit Shah and Devendra Fadnavis are talking about the BJP-led NDA (National Democratic Alliance) government now because they see little possibility of BJP getting majority on its own in 2019. But six months back, the BJP’s tone and language were exactly opposite and they had no regard for other NDA constituents,” Desai said. He also reminded the cadres that Thackeray had twice moved a resolution in the Shiv Sena to state Sena’s commitment to fighting alone in the next elections. “We have no option but fight alone now and that is our decision,” Desai said. \nAddressing the BJP foundation day convention in Mumbai on 6 April, Shah said the NDA under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP would win the general elections and Maharashtra assembly elections in 2019. Later at a press conference, Shah, when asked specifically about the Shiv Sena, said the BJP sincerely wished that the Sena would stay with it. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis went a step ahead and paid lofty tributes to Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray in his speech. \n“While Fadnavis mentioned Balasaheb as an icon for the BJP cadres also and his contribution to the nation and Maharashtra, it was a very thoughtful and strategic ploy. It was a clear message to the current Sena leadership that a split in the Hindutva vote would only help the Congress and NCP (Nationalist Congress Party). After such a gesture and Amit bhai ’s clear stand that the NDA would win the next elections, if the Shiv Sena leadership sticks to its decision to fight alone, it will become very difficult for them to justify this split in the Hindu vote,” said a senior BJP functionary requesting anonymity. \nHowever, many in the Shiv Sena think the BJP has extended this hand of friendship out of political necessity. “...Our cadres are directed by Uddhav saheb, not Amit Shah or Devendra Fadnavis, and they are firmly behind our decision to fight alone,” said another senior Sena MP requesting anonymity, adding, “The BJP needs to retain its allies after Telugu Desam Party’s exit from the NDA and a perceptible change in the public mood.” \nThe BJP functionary cited above, however, said leaders like Raut and Desai were not “the decision makers” in Shiv Sena.

Photo: PTI New Delhi/Mumbai: A day before the Congress party’s nation-wide fast on Monday to promote social harmony and protest against the alleged dilution of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the opposition was trying to politicize the issue. \nIn an effort to reach out to the Dalit community, the BJP leadership has decided to observe the birth anniversary of Jyotirao Phule, the backward caste social reformer, on 11 April as Samta Divas and organize various events on 14 April, the birth anniversary of B.R. Ambedkar. \nDuring a meeting of all members of Parliament (MPs) of his party last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi directed BJP leaders to inform Dalits about the various programmes of the government that work for the development and upliftment of the community. Modi also asked senior Union ministers, MPs, and ministers in BJP-ruled states to visit the Dalit community in the over 20,000 villages where the members of the community have a substantial presence, according to senior BJP leaders. \nThe outreach programmes of both BJP and Congress come in the backdrop of widespread protests by Dalits against the alleged dilution of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act last week. \n“Our party is working to strengthen the SC/ST Act. This is being opposed by Rahul Gandhi. The opposition is indulging in politics in the name of Babasaheb Ambedkar,” said Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Sunday. During a visit by BJP president Amit Shah to Mumbai last week, the party unveiled a major social outreach which includes Dalits and Other Backward Classes (OBC) at the party’s national foundation day. \nThe BJP leadership wants its public representatives to explain initiatives like the Ujwala Yojana and Mudra Yojana to the Dalit community and other socially backward communities. \nBoth parties are trying to increase their social base before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. \nSenior Union ministers also accused the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party of using unconstitutional means to disrupt the development work being carried out by the government for Dalits. \nThe Congress is also brainstorming on a daylong national Dalit meet on 23 April, likely to be held at Talkatora Stadium in the national capital. The meet is set to be attended by all the senior Dalit leaders in the party where Dalit issues will be discussed. \n“What happened last week during the Dalit protests is of grave concern to us. We are looking at a number of party programmes to mobilize Dalit population in order to raise their voice. Party president Rahul Gandhi will also be a key participant in all these events,” a senior party leader involved in the party organization said requesting anonymity. \nApart from this, Congress party is also holding a rally at the Ramlila Maidan in the national capital on 29 April to protest against the current political situation in the country which it said has an “environment of distrust and intolerance” particularly with respect to Dalits.

Sharma Oli signals that more initiatives are needed to reset Delhi-Kathmandu ties Last Published: Mon, Apr 09 2018. 12 00 AM IST Elizabeth Roche Prime Minister Narendra Modi (R) and Prime Minister of Nepal K.P. Sharma Oli shake hands after the inauguration of India-Nepal petroleum products pipeline and the Integrated Check Post (ICP), at Hyderabad House, in New Delhi on Saturday. Photo: AFP New Delhi: It was a visit aimed at repairing the trust deficit, leading in turn, to a reset in ties between India and Nepal. But at the end of Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli’s three-day visit to India on Sunday, it seemed as though bridging the trust deficit between the neighbours would take more work. \nOn Saturday, after talks between prime ministers Narendra Modi and Oli, the two sides unveiled some new “game-changing” initiatives in connectivity, energy cooperation and agriculture. \nThese included a new electrified rail line, to be built with India’s financial support, connecting the border city of Raxaul in India to Kathmandu in Nepal. \nAnother key decision was on the development of inland waterways to help “the movement of cargo, within the framework of trade and transit arrangements, providing additional access to sea for Nepal,” an Indian foreign ministry statement said. \n“This new initiative would enable cost effective and efficient movement of cargo. [Oli] noted the enormous impact the additional connectivity would have on the growth of business and economy of Nepal,” it said. \nThe two leaders also remotely attended the groundbreaking ceremony of South Asia’s first transnational petroleum pipeline to supply fuel from India to Nepal. The 69-km pipeline from Motihari in Bihar to Amlekhganj in Nepal will deliver 2 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of petroleum products to the fuel starved country and will be built at a cost of around Rs200 crore. \nThese decisions are significant given that in the past landlocked Nepal has been seen as keen to develop alternative routes to end its dependence on India for energy, connectivity, trade and transit. The rail link between Raxaul and Kathmandu, for example, could be seen as an attempt by New Delhi to counter China’s reported moves to build a rail link between Tibet and Kathmandu. \nFor a while it seemed these initiatives had helped paper over past differences, created by Indian reservations on Nepal’s 2015 constitution. But Oli’s speech at a civic reception in New Delhi on Saturday left few doubts that more work was needed to bridge the trust deficit. \n“Relations between neighbours differ from that of others...Good neighbourliness demands harmonious co-existence forever. And, trust is the key cementing factor. It derives its strength from the observance of such fundamental principles as equality, justice, mutual respect and benefit as well as non-interference,” Oli said. “As friendly neighbours, our two countries need to be aware of, and respect for, each other’s concerns and sensitivities. Nepal has not allowed its land to be used against the sovereign interests of India. We are firm in our resolve to maintain this position. And it is natural that we expect similar assurance from India,” he said. \nIn a reference to the 2015 blockade of land trade routes between India and Nepal, Oli said, “We need to ensure that bilateral as well as regional connectivity and transit arrangements run smoothly without any interruption at all times. Recourse to obstacles in the movement of goods, services and people should not have any place in today’s interconnected world and in interconnected neighbourhood.” \nIndia was seen as supportive of the Tharus, Madhesis and Janjatis who blocked key supply routes in protest against the new Nepali Constitution that seemed to marginalize them, while privileging hill populations. \nIn 2016, Oli had accused India of breaking up a fragile coalition he was heading and forcing him to quit.

Both marches will end with a public meeting in Cuddalore on 12 April. \n“It was in 1938 that Periyar (E.V. Ramasamy) flagged off a rally from Trichy to Chennai that stopped the imposition of Hindi. Today, from the same Trichy, we have started this rally and will definitely succeed,” said DMK’s working president M.K. Stalin on Saturday. \nMeanwhile, T.T.V. Dhinakaran who heads the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) began a march in Dharmapuri on Saturday. He will hold demonstrations across the state and will end with a rally in Nagapattinam on 27 April. \nWith tension escalating between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over the Cauvery issue, governor Banwarilal Purohit’s move to appoint M.K. Surappa of Karnataka as the vice-chancellor of Anna University in Tamil Nadu has also irked opposition parties. \nThe widespread protests in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry over the Cauvery row culminated in a day-long bandh on Thursday. Farmers’ associations, students’ organizations, lawyers, individuals and various other outfits have jumped in over the past week, with road and rail blockades and attempts to lay siege to central government buildings. \nThere is also growing demand from political parties to boycott the IPL matches at M.A. Chidambaram stadium in Chennai with some political outfits saying they will disrupt the matches. \nIn the last one week, the walls in Chennai that were painted with the “Whistle Podu” slogan of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) team have been changed into “We want Cauvery” and “Cauvery is our Right”. The home team takes on Kolkata Knight Riders in Chennai on Tuesday. \nWhile Stalin has asked the IPL authorities to take into consideration the people’s sentiment, Dhinakaran recently urged people to boycott IPL as a mark of protest. Joining them in the demand was actor-turned politician Rajinikanth, who on Sunday said: “It would be an embarrassment if IPL matches are held during this time, when Tamil Nadu is protesting (for CMB).

I foresee the ruling NDA coalition collapsing as never before," he predicted. \nGandhi was on a two-day visit to the southern state since Saturday for the sixth time in two months to campaign for the party. \n"I don\'t see the BJP winning the next election in the face of a united opposition and rising public anger against its government and leadership," he said. \nIn the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Gandhi said the Congress would not only win in Karnataka, but also in Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were assembly elections are due later this year. \nALSO READ: Lok Sabha polls: PM Modi, Shah banking on a handful of leaders with skills \n"How and from where the BJP will win seats when other opposition and reginal parties close ranks and contest jointly against it in the 2019 polls," he said. \nGandhi also ruled out a third front against the Congress and the BJP in the next year\'s general elections. \nLater, Gandhi participated at the ruling party\'s \'Jan Ashirvada Yatra\', held for the people\'s blessings in the May 12 Karnataka assembly election. \nNoting that the assembly poll would be a battle of ideologies between the Congress and the BJP, Gandhi said Bengaluru\'s founder Kempegowda and Karnataka\'s 12th century social reformer Basavanna taught on how to take everyone together for the good of all and on the development path. \n"Bengaluru is the symbol of modern India. Besides (state-run enterprises like) HAL, ISRO, BEL, BEML and ITI, it has best academic and research institutions like IISc and IIM, which attracted global IT firms and multinationals," said Gandhi, who earlier in the day, interacted with workers of the city civic corporation, women entrepreneurs and top executives of India Inc here. \nRahul, Sonia will lose their LS seats in 2019, says BJP \nHitting back at Rahul Gandhi for claiming that Prime Minister Narendra Modi may lose from Varanasi in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP on Sunday said the Congress president and his mother, Sonia Gandhi, will lose from their respective constituencies due to the people\'s growing "disappointment" with them. \nBJP spokesperson Anil Baluni said Rahul Gandhi should not worry about Modi and should rather be concerned about his and Sonia Gandhi\'s electoral fate in 2019. \n"In the kind of circumstances prevailing today, both Rahul and his mother, Sonia Gandhi, will lose from their seats, Amethi and Raebareli, respectively. They have done nothing in their constituencies and the people\'s disappointment with them is growing," he said. \nThe comments came in the backdrop of Rahul Gandhi\'s claim that Modi may lose from Varanasi against a united opposition in 2019.

TNN | Apr 9, 2018, 00:20 IST NEW DELHI: In a surprise move, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday visited Tughlak Road police station to meet Telugu Desam Party MPs detained by police while marching towards the official residence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . The MPs were demanding special category status for Andhra Pradesh. Kejriwal justified TDP’s demands for special status and put the blame for the detention of the MPs on Modi. “It is very sad that when the MPs went to meet the PM, he got them detained instead of giving them an audience. This is not democracy, it is arrogance. We condemn this,” he said. The Telugu Desam Party MPs were bundled into a bus by police and CRPF personnel from Race Course Road from where they had started the march and sent to Tughlak Road police station. During the informal meet, Kejriwal expressed his support to the MPs. “The demand being made by AP government and TDP for special status to the state is completely justified. It should be granted. We support the demand,” he added. The show of solidarity comes four days after a meeting between Kejriwal and Telugu Desam Party president and AP CM N Chandrababu Naidu in Delhi where the two CMs discussed the prevailing political situation, the demand of AP for special category status, among other issues. Interestingly, the meeting was held after Telugu Desam Party pulled out of BJP-led NDA setting the tone for new political alignments. With Naidu hitting out at the PM, Kejriwal has found it convenient to cosy up to the Andhra Pradesh chief minister in the middle of the new undercurrents for the union of regional political parties against BJP ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

The first list of candidates who will contest Karnataka Assembly polls 2018 was announced after a meeting of the BJP's Central Election Committee. The meeting at party headquarters in Delhi was chaired by party President Amit Shah. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, former Karnataka chief minister B S Yeddyurappa reportedly attended the meeting. \nBJP has already announced Yeddyurappa as its chief ministerial candidate, with a target of winning 150 out of 224 assembly seats. Yeddyurappa was earlier forced to resign as chief minister in 2011 over graft charges, following which he quit the party to form his own outfit, the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP), which failed to make a mark except for damage BJP's prospects in 2013 polls. \nHe returned to BJP following the announcement of Narendra Modi as party's prime ministerial candidate ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. \nUnlike in 2013, when BJP was split into factions with Yeddyurappa forming KJP and B Sriramulu of Ballari floating BSR Congress, they are all fighting as a unified force this time around.

I would like to tell the Central government that if this fair, strong demand of the people of Tamil Nadu is not met, the Centre will have to face the anger and disenchantment of the people of Tamil Nadu. It should be formed as soon as possible,” said Mr. Rajinikanth. \nHe said the protests were primarily organised for poor farmers who owned small agricultural land. “We are protesting for small farmers. The protests are not focussing on their plight. The media should highlight the plight of such farmers. Even if politicians in Karnataka don’t see the point, the farmers there might understand the plight of the farmers here and it will strengthen the protests,” said Mr. Rajinikanth. \nSterlite issue \nExplaining his stance on protests against Sterlite copper plant, he said, “Any industry that pollutes the environment should not be allowed in the State. Even if it brings the State several lakh crores of revenue and brings jobs for several lakhs of people, such industries shouldn’t be allowed.” Asked about the growing demand that IPLT-20 cricket matches in Chennai should be cancelled to show solidarity, Mr. Rajinikanth said, “When the whole of Tamil Nadu is protesting for the CMB, it is definitely embarrassing that a celebration such as IPL is being held at this time. If they cancel it, it will be good. If not, at least Chennai Super Kings players can play wearing a black badge in solidarity. The message will reach throughout India. If that is not possible, the fans can go to the stadium wearing a black badges in solidarity. The BCCI, IPL authorities and the owners of CSK must cooperate in this regard.” \nThe actor also said only the timing of appointment of Karnataka-based Surappa as the Vice-Chancellor of Anna University was wrong. “India is a country where people of all religions and castes live together. Anyone can work in any part of country. But the appointment, which has come at a time when there has been protests, was wrong,” he said. \nReacting to actor Kamal Haasan’s opinion that he would oppose his politics if he pursued ‘spiritual’ politics, the actor said, “He is not my enemy at all. My enemy is poverty, unemployment, the tears of poor, fishermen and plight of Sri Lankan refugees.”', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T23:15:00.008+03:00', 'uuid': '18b268b1da5d1ec59e8cf3ed4560b10d023f74ad', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T22:35:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Rajini asks CSK players to wear black badges', 'site': 'thehindu.com', 'main_image': 'http://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg', 'domain_rank': 806, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'Rajini asks CSK players to wear black badges', 'uuid': '18b268b1da5d1ec59e8cf3ed4560b10d023f74ad', 'site_section': 'http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/?service=rss', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 6, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 6}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T22:35:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'IN', 'site_full': 'www.thehindu.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdZv0q8zoC4PCrEk7tj4Twacgq7B9Wv2uq1fyK1PuyYQ2yh4BX4.Rmb0nMhAZhaQdKHshymrGUiZYSOYaqgJ2TSNYTpouvq8xlQ59Ej9qgWzKdRDGYfSAg3hOeqN92OFqL', 'section_title': 'The Hindu - National'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'tamil nadu', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'rajini', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'rajinikanth', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'csk', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'cauvery board', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'supreme court', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'cauvery management board', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'cmb', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'chennai super kings', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdZv0q8zoC4PCrEk7tj4Twacgq7B9Wv2uq1fyK1PuyYQ2yh4BX4.Rmb0nMhAZhaQdKHshymrGUiZYSOYaqgJ2TSNYTpouvq8xlQ59Ej9qgWzKdRDGYfSAg3hOeqN92OFqL', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'Special Correspondent', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Determined to show black flags to PM: Stalin', 'text': 'April 09, 2018 00:58 IST Updated: April 09, 2018 00:58 IST more-in \nDMK working president M.K.

Doreswamy', 'text': 'April 09, 2018 00:20 IST Updated: April 09, 2018 00:20 IST more-in Assembly Elections \nHe is a freedom fighter, a journalist, and above all a man who has led citizens’ movements for everything from providing housing to the landless to preventing dumping of garbage at Mandur. And on Tuesday, this tireless citizen turns 100. \nH.S. Doreswamy started out in the freedom movement as a revolutionary, helping plant time bombs to burn government records in British India. He was jailed during the Quit India Movement and turned a Gandhian later. Mr. Doreswamy recently suffered a bout of illness, but that has not dampened his spirits. He is actively trying to stitch up a secular coalition against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the forthcoming Assembly elections. The Hindu caught up with him on the eve of his centenary. Excerpts: \nYou have seen all the elections in independent India. What is the significance of the the 2018 Karnataka Assembly elections? \nI have described this election as Modi vs Karnataka. If the BJP captures power in Karnataka too, Narendra Modi may end up being a dictator. Democracy is already at peril. The Modi juggernaut has to be stopped here. As a group of civil society activists, we are working towards mobilising people to support secular parties — the Congress and the JD(S). Not that we are happy with these parties, but in real politics we need to support parties that have a chance of winning. We will work to hold these parties accountable. \nBut we are also concerned about which way the JD(S) will go after the polls, given the party’s history of siding with the BJP. We met JD(S) national president H.D. Deve Gowda once and will continue to persuade him not to side with the BJP. More than making his son Chief Minister again, Deve Gowda should look at the national interest. This mobilisation of support must continue into 2019 as well to defeat the BJP in the nation. \nAs a freedom fighter, how do you see the ongoing nationalism debate in the country? \nNationalism is not something a person in power decides and imposes. My nationalism is a civic nationalism prevalent among the common citizens who celebrate diversity and don’t try to regiment the country into ‘Hindu-Hindi-Hindustan’. \nI find the opposition to linguistic and regional identity, like Kannada identity, in the name of nationalism funny. Kannada identity and my nationalism are not opposing forces; they complement each other. Linguistic regions were created to decentralise power and give autonomy to cultures. Opposing them would be killing the federal spirit. \nThough you were an active Congress worker in your youth, you chose civil activism over electoral politics. What is the role of civil society you foresee in politics? \nInfluenced by Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave, I have always felt citizen activism is effective and better than electoral politics. The real opposition to today’s Union government has emerged from the civil society, students, Dalits and farmers. Mainstream political parties such as the Congress have failed to build on this opposition. \nBut what ails many of our social movements is that they have taken the easy way out — going to the courts with PIL petitions. This will weaken the movements in the long run. During the old days, no activist leading an agitation approached the courts, as if he or she did so, the person should abide by the court’s ruling, which will only compromise the agitation. There is no alternative to mobilising people. I have been involved in three social movements in the past few years — to stop dumping waste in Mandur, for providing housing to the landless poor, and for the implementation of the A.T. Ramaswamy report on encroached government land. All of them were a success as the government was forced to respond as the moral pressure on them grew and we kept up the persuasion. \nWhat keeps you going at 100? \nLooking back, I have led a content life and have done my bit to keep our governments in check. I will do that till I am there. The baton needs to be taken over by the next generation. This is a continuous process. Inequality has been growing at such a fast pace. We need to get back to the Sarvodaya movement and start with Antyodaya.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T23:15:33.001+03:00', 'uuid': '96952a50099c7ae81b605f71331065a7b6ce8644', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T21:50:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Modi juggernaut has to be stopped in Karnataka: H.S.

Parliament functioning has been disrupted for over 20 days. \nThe discussion was attended by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and senior Congress leaders, was part of his election campaign in Karnataka, which is going to polls on May 12. He also criticised several policies and projects initiated by the Modi-led NDA government, including the loopholes in GST, state of finances and bullet train project. \nStating that the country was heading into “serious bad weather” considering how the NPAs are being handled and structured, the Congress chief said the government was not listening to experts and the Prime Minister thought he can handle the financial front too. “Now, he is finding out that he cannot do it.” \nTerming the bullet train project between Ahmedabad and Mumbai as just a “show piece”, Mr. Gandhi said the government was spending ₹1 lakh crore on a badly conceptualised project, which is not part of a larger strategy. “I’m not against bullet trains if they are part of a strategy. There might be places in India where you may want to use it.” \nOver the next 20 to 30 years, he said that the competition would be with China and there is a need to create jobs. \nOn whether the Congress would bring petroleum products under GST, Mr. Gandhi said it will have a re-look into GST. “We do not agree with the basic composition of GST. We will completely transform it from the current five layers to one single layer, which will also have petroleum products under its fold,” he said. “The current GST is designed to hurt small and medium industries and to protect 10 to 15 large businessmen in India,” he alleged. \nHe said a national manifesto of the Congress will be prepared and released soon. Interactions will be held with different groups and their issues will be discussed within the party before preparing the manifesto, he said. His announcement of the manifesto came in response to certain suggestions made by small and medium industrialists seeking concession in the existing borrowing criteria, rate of interest, and other issues in the SME sector.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T23:15:38.012+03:00', 'uuid': '1cbb432dc559e1defc26f1bd4801661afa1f9d3a', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T21:41:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Modi blamed for Parliament disruption', 'site': 'thehindu.com', 'main_image': 'http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/article23475520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGRAHULINDUSTRIALIST', 'domain_rank': 806, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'Modi blamed for Parliament disruption', 'uuid': '1cbb432dc559e1defc26f1bd4801661afa1f9d3a', 'site_section': 'http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/?service=rss', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 1, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 1}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T21:41:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'IN', 'site_full': 'www.thehindu.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdZv0q8zoC4PBSXMbW33Ob5hjSt9dc7tXTq0GTNmPVw3Wkb1u7NAUxBqQXykqdr4RCQevng3lPJCwoIF9P3fPSSk9WjqyAyftS.skT01Y8Ht8hcKy5tA3X7w--', 'section_title': 'The Hindu - National'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'karnataka', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'rafal', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'rahul gandhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'nirav modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'mehul choksi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'siddaramaiah', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'parliament', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'gitanjali group', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'congress', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'aicc', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'nda', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdZv0q8zoC4PBSXMbW33Ob5hjSt9dc7tXTq0GTNmPVw3Wkb1u7NAUxBqQXykqdr4RCQevng3lPJCwoIF9P3fPSSk9WjqyAyftS.skT01Y8Ht8hcKy5tA3X7w--', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'Special Correspondent', 'external_links': [], 'title': '‘Only top 15 businessmen enjoying achhe din’', 'text': 'April 09, 2018 00:07   15:56 IST more-in \nAll-India Congress Committee president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said except about 15 businessmen, no one was enjoying achhe din under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. \nAlleging that there was a lot discrimination under the Modi regime, Mr. Gandhi said the BJP’s parent organisation Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has been running the country from its headquarters in Nagpur. \nIn an interaction with a few journalists over breakfast, he said the people of South India and north-east India, minorities, Dalits, and entrepreneurs were being discriminated against. “When Nagpur runs the country, right by definition there has to be discrimination. Tell me who is happy other than the top 15 businessmen in India?” Mr .Gandhi said. \nReferring to Mahatma Gandhi’s “million mutinies”, he said that today, there were a million mutinies in India. “He (Mr. Modi) has been unable to run the country and that’s why you are seeing Dalits up in arms, tribals up in arms... you are seeing farmers taking out rallies in Maharashtra,” the Congress president said. \nMr. Gandhi said the Opposition parties have united and would fight an ideological battle against the BJP government in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. “Mr. Modi will be defeated. We are already winning. You can see the Prime Minister is completely lost. What has happened in India now is that the Opposition’s unity is very strong. Mr. Modi has no chance to win in 2019.” \nTo a question on the Congress’ vision for the future, Mr. Gandhi said: “I think there are lessons for us from 2014. We also made mistakes. We have to accept that and understand that... of course, there were a lot of lies, a lot of false allegations, a lot of venom spread by the BJP and the RSS.” \nHe said the Congress would give a vision for India to move forward. “The party is preparing the vision based on how to create jobs, how to protect farmers, how to ensure education and provide healthcare at the lowest possible cost, and how to position India in the world.

According to highly placed authoritative sources in Jammu and New Delhi, a senior IAS officer would be appointed as Chief Secretary in Jammu and Kashmir, after a series of consultations between Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti and the Central government, a little over a month from now. Likewise, new Governor for J&K would be appointed in the middle of June. Retired bureaucrat Vohra, who will attain age of 82 years on May 5, 2018, was appointed Governor of Jammu and Kashmir in the thick of Amarnath land allotment row. In turbulent conditions, he succeeded Lt Gen (retired) S.K. Sinha at Raj Bhavan in Srinagar on June 25, 2008. Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government granted an extension to his term when he completed five years in office in June 2013. Even as the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance fired several governors and created conditions for resignation of several others when it assumed power in 2014, Vohra was left intact in the politically hypersensitive State. Reportedly on a couple of occasions, he had conveyed his willingness to step down and take retirement but the BJP top brass, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urged him to continue in his office. His extended tenure is finally ending on June 24. Sources revealed to STATE TIMES that around a dozen contenders had already begun lobbying in New Delhi for arguably the country’s most sensitive gubernatorial position. At least three of them are believed to be seeking support from the RSS top brass in Nagpur. One of the aspirants is believed to be a retired Army officer. Sources, however, did not confirm whether it was former GOC of Srinagar-based 15 Corps Lt Gen (retired) Syed Ata Hasnain, or a different officer who has served a term as GOC-in-C of Northern Command. The contenders, according to sources, include retired IAS and IPS officers as also a couple of BJP leaders though political persons have not been appointed Governor in J&K since long. Mehbooba Mufti will have to zero in on someone as Chief Secretary days before Vyas’s second extension of three months ends on May 31. Superannuating on November 30, 2017, Vyas had been given extension of six months in two installments on recommendation of J&K Chief Minister. The 1986 IAS officer from Rajasthan, Vyas had been appointed Chief Secretary upon B.R. Sharma’s Central deputation in April 2017. He took over on April 28, 2017. With distinction of an unparalleled profile, experience on all key positions including Principal Secretary to Governor and Principal Secretary to three successive Chief Ministers—Omar Abdullah, Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Mehbooba Mufti—besides Central and international deputations, Vyas is likely to be considered for a coveted position after his retirement on May 31. B.R. Sharma (IAS-1984) and K.B. Agarwal (IAS-1985) are the only two IAS officers senior to Vyas in the J&K bureaucracy. Son of the soil, Sharma, who was appointed as Chief Secretary upon Iqbal Khanday’s voluntary retirement on September 7, 2015, proceeded on Central deputation on May 17, 2017, days after he was dramatically replaced by Vyas. Having held most of the key positions in J&K, Sharma is rated as the most potential candidate for Chief Secretary if the government fails to find a suitable match to Vyas. Currently posted as Additional Secretary in the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, Sharma has been empanelled as Secretary by the Government of India. He has post-graduations in Political Science and Business Administration besides graduation in Law. In addition to being the senior most IAS officer of J&K cadre, Sharma alone will have 23 months of service upon Vyas’s retirement. Graduate in Civil Engineering and a resident of U.P, Agarwal was in 2017 recalled from New Delhi where he served as Principal Resident Commissioner of J&K Government. Contrary to the tradition in bureaucracy, Agarwal agreed to a posting in Civil Secretariat despite being senior to Chief Secretary Vyas. He is currently posted as Financial Commissioner Housing and Urban Development and believed to be a favourite of the Deputy Chief Minister and Minister of H&UDD Dr Nirmal Singh. Rated to be the second potential contender, after Sharma, Agarwal will have only 8 months of active service upon Vyas’s retirement. Of the 1986-batch IAS officers, Rakesh Kumar Gupta, Lokesh Dutt Jha and Suresh Kumar are immediate followers or Vyas. Gupta, a resident of Delhi with B. Tech and MBA, is currently posted as Principal Resident Commissioner of J&K Government in New Delhi. His last posting in J&K was Principal Secretary Forest. He will be having 21 months of active service on the day of Vyas’s retirement. L.D. Jha, hailing from U.P, whose academic qualification is Master of Philosophy, is currently posted as Financial Commissioner Revenue. He will be left with 13 months of active service on retirement of Vyas. The last of the IAS-1986 officers, Suresh Kumar of Himachal Pradesh, who has Masters in Agriculture Sciences, is currently on Central deputation and posted as Additional Secretary in Ministry of Coal. He will be having exactly one year of service on the day of Vyas’s retirement. According to sources, considering Gupta, Jha and Kumar would be the third and the last option as the Government would first make an assessment of B.R. Sharma and K.B. Agarwal who are both senior to Vyas. The second option would be getting an incumbent from the Centre.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T23:22:06.012+03:00', 'uuid': 'ace1f67b8df6f8572343a2f3ca1c3561cbb93b0b', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T22:35:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Search begins for new Governor, Chief Secretary in J', 'site': 'statetimes.in', 'main_image': 'http://news.statetimes.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ST-LOGO.jpg', 'domain_rank': None, 'site_type': 'blogs', 'title': 'Search begins for new Governor, Chief Secretary in J', 'uuid': 'ace1f67b8df6f8572343a2f3ca1c3561cbb93b0b', 'site_section': 'http://news.statetimes.in/feed/', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T22:35:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'IN', 'site_full': 'news.statetimes.in', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUG30GEZjpk8DNYhgLiglufIlA5N2K8Vfg_ZTVDhYJPc_KSrZTo4K1ajj1fJXEQSw06Mm5LnqT1pFPfeoo6ABrR45bNbS7oejI-', 'section_title': 'State Times'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'new delhi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'raj bhavan', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'kashmir', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'srinagar', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'jammu', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'vohra', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'ahmed ali fayyaz', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'mehbooba mufti', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bharat bhushan vyas', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'vyas', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'narendra nath vohra', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 's.k. sinha', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'ias', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJUG30GEZjpk8DNYhgLiglufIlA5N2K8Vfg_ZTVDhYJPc_KSrZTo4K1ajj1fJXEQSw06Mm5LnqT1pFPfeoo6ABrR45bNbS7oejI-', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'State Times', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Mehbooba to take up Sharda temple issue with PM', 'text': 'Home News Jammu and Kashmir Jammu Mehbooba to take up Sharda temple issue with PM Mehbooba to take up Sharda temple issue with PM on: 0 \nSTATE TIMES NEWS JAMMU: Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti on Sunday assured a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits that she would place before Prime Minister Narendra Modi their long-pending demand to reopen the Sharda temple in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) on Monday.

The party made the announcement in this connection on Friday after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a fast by BJP MPs on April 12 to protest the impasse in Parliament for which he blamed the opposition party. Congress President Rahul Gandhi , Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) President Ajay Maken and other senior leaders will sit on a day-long fast on Monday from 10.30 AM to 4.30 PM in front of VIP Gate, Gandhi Samadhi, Rajghat to protect and promote communal harmony across the nation.

Hitting back at the BJP on Friday, the Congress had said that it was the government which was responsible for not letting Parliament function and termed as a “gimmick” and “drama” the move by NDA MPs to forgo their salary for 23 days when Parliament did not function. Addressing a joint press conference, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge and party’s senior spokesperson Anand Sharma said their party MPs had met the Rajya Sabha chairman requesting him that house should not be prorogued so that it can be reconvened for two more weeks to discuss issues of national importance as they could not be taken up due to disruptions. Kharge also accused the BJP and RSS of spreading hatred in society through their “divisive” agenda. “The Congress “will expose it” and their chief Rahul Gandhi has appealed to the public to maintain peace and harmony in society,” he said. Kharge also alleged that it was the government and its allies which were disrupting the Lok Sabha and questioned why members causing disturbance were not suspended and the no-confidence motions taken up for discussion.

He said that the Modi government will “never end reservation nor let others do it” \n“The JMI and AMU are central universities but the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government made them minority institutions. And hence reservation for SC and ST students does not apply there. \n“But these are funded by the central government. Any institution funded or aided by the Central government must have provisions of reservation for SC, ST and OBCs as per the Central government rules. We have presented our side in the Supreme Court and also submitted a changed affidavit. Now waiting for apex court’s response,” Gehlot said. \nHe said that the Modi government will “never end reservation nor let others do it”. \nHe also targeted fellow Dalit leader and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati, saying she was digressing from the path of party founder Kanshi Ram. \n“Kanshi Ram did not believe in violence but Mayawati is not following in his footsteps,” Gehlot said as he and Union Law Minister Ravi Shanker Prasad accused the BSP, Samajwadi Party and the Congress of fanning Dalit violence in different parts of the country for “political gains”. \nEarlier, the Congress questioned Modi’s “stoic silence” over the concerns of Dalits and said it indicated that the BJP and RSS were working towards a “Dalit-mukt Bharat”. \nThe Congress said that despite massive protests and outcry on the streets over the dilution of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in the wake of a Supreme Court ruling on March 20, the Prime Minister has maintained silence. \nHowever, Gehlot said that the Narendra Modi government has only “strengthened” the SC/ST Act and went on to list various schemes for the uplift/welfare of the Dalits launched by the Modi government since 2014.

He visited India in February 2016 during his first term. \n“My official visit to India was significant and fruitful,” Oli said at the Tribhuvan International Airport upon his arrival. The visit has further strengthened bilateral relations between Nepal and India, Oli told the reporters. \n“The bilateral relations will move forward in a new direction on the basis of equality and mutual interest,” said Oli. “We have agreed to expedite past agreements and understandings reached between the two countries,” he added. \n“The visit has helped in clearing misunderstanding and mistrust and strengthening mutual trust and understanding,” Oli said. During the talks the two countries agreed to conduct feasibility studies regarding construction of Raxaul- Kathmandu railway line and operating Nepalese steamers to transport goods and people from Nepal to other countries. \nOther important agreements have been reached in cooperation in agriculture and hydropower sectors. Many observers see Oli as favouring a closer relationship between Nepal and China. However, the issue of China- Nepal ties was not discussed during the delegation-level talks. \nOli’s first tenure as Prime Minister saw protests by Indian-origin Madeshi people in the southern Terai (plains) region over the new Constitution of Nepal. The Madhesis say the new Constitution is discriminatory to their interests. They had blocked major trading points between India and Nepal, preventing goods from reaching the landlocked country. The months-long blockade had led to souring of the ties between the two countries.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has been hit by lengthy procurement process, indecisions and confusing signals over Twin or Single Engine issues, Transfer of Technology (ToT) and Indigenous Production requirements, a backlog of 20 years, woefully low budgets for acquiring new Aircraft and Systems and the curse of political allegations. \nFor whatever reasons, the Government withdrew the 2007 tender for 126 Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) and ordered 36 Rafales, which had won the competition, as a stopgap measure. The allegations over this have apparently blocked either their further purchase or those of other aircraft. \nIn his farewell press briefing, former IAF Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha had put the number of Twin and Single Engine MMRCAs required by IAF at 400, although he did also say that IAF could do with 300 so as to lower the financial burden. This is also the view at the Air Headquarters. \nThe projected number of some 200 or more indigenous Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) were in addition to them, not as their replacement. \nThe LCAs are meant to replace the Soviet vintage MiG-21s, but have been slow in the making. Nonetheless, there is some movement forward and its maker, HAL, has been able to integrate an AESA radar, midair refueling pod and an Israeli Electronic Warfare suite for producing its Mk1 version. \nThe IAF though needs more powerful Twin and Single Engine aircraft, as defined by the Air Headquarters, as well as the LCA Mk1. Our combat aircraft have to have the reach to effectively hit an enemy in his territory and come back safely. That has to be The Key to acquiring Capability. \nWith the planned phase out of all variants of MiG-21 and MiG-27 fleets by 2020 and 2027, respectively, IAF is already looking at the horrifying scenario of going down to less than 30 squadrons unless very urgent fast-track procurements are initiated. \nThe authorised strength of 42 squadrons, or about 882 aircraft – 21 for each Squadron inclusive of three for Maintenance Reserve and Strike Off Wastage (MRSOW) – could take two decades to make good, if timely decisions are taken at least now. \nIAF has been losing two Squadrons every year due to obsolescence, and the number required now could fairly be put at 500. There is thus a need to take stock of what are the viable options. \nPerspective India is among the world’s most threatened nations with two hostile nuclear armed neighbours with serious boundary issues. The Service Chiefs have routinely flagged the possibility of a two-front war, or at least not ruled it out as a collusive threat. \nIAF’s main strength is its fleet of about 240 Su-30 MKI aircraft, to which another 30 would be added in the next two years to take the total to 272, or 13 Squadrons. All other aircraft are of Soviet or 1980s vintage. Although three squadrons each of the MiG- 29s and Mirage 2000s are under upgrades, they are unlikely to serve for more than a decade after upgradations and their replacement programmes also need to start now. \nChina already has state-of-the-art aircraft manufacturing programmes in every department of military aviation – Fighters, Large Transports, Attack and Utility Helicopters, AEW&C, UAVs, and Missiles, etc. The J-31 and J-20 fighters with AESA radars and stealth features are under induction. The People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) has nearly 2,200 mainstream aircraft including 750 state-of-the-art combat jets. \nThere is also the China and Russia contract for 24 Su-35 with advanced IRBIS-E AESA radar. Their deliveries are due from 2018. \nChina spends a huge $25 billion on defence R&D. \nPakistan, China’s only military ally besides North Korea, has 22 combat Squadrons with 400 aircraft, and is planning to raise their number to 28 Squadrons. \nOptions for IAF There were six aircraft in the MMRCA competition, and after its withdrawal in 2007, two of them, Lockheed Martin F-16 and Saab Gripen, were in a revised ‘Single Engine’ aircraft competition. That programme is also now cancelled, and there are indications for still another competition on the lines of the 2007 MMRCA competition, or MMRCA II. As IAF has all the trial reports with it, the decision to issue the procedural Request for Proposals (RfP) or a Request for Quotations (RfQ) should not take much time after the participants submit their responses to the Request for Information (RFI) as and when it is issued in accordance with the existing DPP. Both the IAF and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have competent teams to decide on the long-term costing and make in India advantages with Transfer of Technology (TOT). \nIn principle, the selection should be left to the user. \nIn the fray once again should be the latest variants of two proven war horses from the US, Boeing’s Advanced Super Hornet F-18 and Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Block 70, French Rafale, Swedish Saab Gripen NG, Russian MiG-35 and maybe Europan consortium’s Eurofighter. \nBoeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet The Boeing F/A18E/F Super Hornet is a twin-engine multirole fighter. In fact, the aircraft can be described as the flag bearer of the US military strength as it operates from all the US Navy aircraft carriers, and is the first to be engaged in a crisis anywhere in the world where the US intervenes. \nThe F-18 first flew in 1978 as Hornet, and is operated by US Marines and US Navy, Royal Australian and Spanish Air Forces among others. It is loaded with sophisticated avionics, and one of its variants, EA-18G Growler is meant for Electronic Warfare (EW). The aircraft is equipped with Infra red Search and Track (IRST) system, an IAF requirement specified in the 2007 competition. \nThe Hornet and Super Hornet have successfully taken part in the Gulf and Middle East wars, and their deployment onboard the aircraft carriers around the world is meant to project Pentagon’s will and show of strength. The Super Hornet has a new larger airframe and has seen extensive avionics upgrades. The variant being offered to India, with Make in India provision, will be Advanced Super Hornet with perhaps a newer AESA radar. At present, it is Raytheon’s APG-79. \nBoeing and Tata Industries have a joint-venture company at Hyderabad for Apache helicopter and 787 Dreamliner aero-structures. If selected, a new entity could be set up to supply components for Boeing military aircraft world-wide. Boeing also has partnerships with some other Indian companies for sourcing structural components for civil and military aircraft. \nThis is the first time the Super Hornet is being offered for production in a foreign country. Boeing has promised to support taking Indian manufacturing to global standards. \nIt may be noted that the Indian Navy is looking for 57 twin-engine shipboard fighter jets. IAF, which wants a ratio of 60:40 ratio between Twin and Single Engine aircraft, may also opt for it if both the forces converge on the choice. \nAbout 200 aircraft could be made in India then. \nEurofighter Typhoon. This Twin-Engine four-nation fighter was shortlisted by IAF along with Rafale in the MMRCA competition but lost to the French in lifecycle costing. \nInterestingly, Airbus, also a European multi-nation entity, owns 36 per cent each in both the Eurofighter and Rafale. It had also promised to make India its fifth partner in the venture besides Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy where it is going to be the mainstay of their air defence and strike operations. \nThe Eurofighter is a twin-engine, canard-delta wing multirole fighter manufactured by a consortium of Airbus, BAE Systems, and Leonardo formed in 1986. The aircraft entered operational service in 2003 and around 600 have been built till date and flown be 10 Air Forces. \nIt is an agile-fighter that has seen operations in Libya. \nLockheed Martin F-16 Block 70 The F-16 Fighting Falcon is a single-engine air-superiority, multi-role fighter aircraft which first flew in 1974 and has since been operated by 26 countries. It is upgraded every now and then, and according to the manufacturer, while the design of the airframe stays, everything inside is new, contemporary, and easily upgradable through periodic replacement of modules to meet future threats and requirements. \nBahrain in fact ordered 16 plus 3 as options in October 2017, and it is the same Block 70 variant which is being offered to IAF with its entire defence industrial infrastructure for Make in India, with a promise to make India its global supply chain hub even for the US Air Force (USAF) in the coming years. \nThe previous variant, Block 60, with an Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar from Northrop Grumman, was inducted by the UAE Air Force in 2004, and their periodic upgrade has just been ordered to keep them flying for another 20 to 25 years. \nThe F-16 commands the distinction for being the largest selling combat jet in the world; about 4,600 variants have been sold and 2,242 are still operational. If IAF selects the F-16, their service and spares could partly be sourced from India. \nThe F-16 Block 70 is built to exploit the aircraft’s long combat experience, and introducing new front-end technologies including Northrop Grumman’s advanced APG-83 AESA radar and enhanced battle-space awareness avionics. On offer are also many weapons including latest versions of the AIM-120 AMRAAM. \nThe aircraft is powered by GE F110-132A engine. The structural life of the aircraft has been extended by more than 50 per cent beyond that of previous production F-16 aircraft, and conformal fuel tanks have been added to give it a longer range. Operational capabilities are enhanced through an advanced data-link, targeting pod and weapons; precision GPS navigation and the Automatic Ground Collision Avoidance System (Auto GCAS). \nLockheed Martin has a joint venture company with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) which has proven expertise through manufacture of airframe components for the C-130J airlifter and the S-92 helicopter. \nNotably, the Pakistan Air Force has around 100 older Block 52s, first inducted in 1982. The Block 70 would be a class apart. \nLockheed Martin has an agreement with the Tata Group to make the aircraft in India on selection as mandated by the MoD. \nLockheed Martin has projected a requirement of 200 aircraft internationally besides another 200 or so for IAF. \nMikoyan MiG-35 Russia unveiled the latest variant of this multirole fighter before military representative from 30 countries in Moscow in January 2018, and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Olegovich Rogozin told an India Strategic representative invited for the occasion that Moscow was ready to offer this aircraft to India for Make in India production. A proposal would be on the agenda of the periodic meetings of the Joint Military-Industrial Conference The MiG-35 is a multi-role fighter, which is essentially a further development of the MiG-29M2. \nThe single-seat version is designated MiG-35 and the two-seat version MiG-35D. The fighter has improved avionics and weapon systems, including a new AESA radar, precision-guided targeting and midair refueling capability. \nIAF is well versed with the Russian aircraft, and the first MiG-29 Squadron was inducted in IAF in 1987. Later, the Indian Navy acquired its naval variant, MiG-29K, for carrier deck operations from INS Vikramaditya, which operated with the Russian Navy as Admiral Gorshkov. \nRafale The Twin-Engine French Rafale has the advantage of being selected by Indian Air Force in the MMRCA competition but a deal for the required 126 aircraft could not be signed as the manufacturer, Dassault Aviation, declined to take responsibility for the quality of production at HAL. It was willing to meet the stipulated offsets requirements as mandated in the RfP, but could take responsibility for what it produced itself, and not for HAL. \nThe RfP was then cancelled, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed a Government-to-Government (G-to-G) agreement with France then for 36 aircraft as a stopgap measure. During President Emanuel Macron’s recent visit here, France took up the supply of another 36 or more aircraft but no decision seems to have emerged. \nIAF selected the omni-role Rafale after a gruelling selection process in the Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) competition for 126 aircraft, envisaging some Transfer of Technology (ToT) and Make in India. It has operationally been tested in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Mali. Rafale is universally acknowledged as a good aircraft. \nRafale’s delivery schedule is reportedly on track for inductions from 2019. In view of the depleting numbers of IAF Squadrons, one school of thought has been to order additional Rafales, even though expensive. Depending on additional numbers, they could either be with Make-in-India option or a Government-to-Government (G2G) direct purchase. There are four partners in the Rafale International for the deal with India, Dassault, Safran, Thales and MBDA. Each has signed an agreement with an Indian entity to meet 50 per cent offsets requirement under the deal. \nSaab Gripen JAS 39 E/F NG JAS 39 Gripen first flew in December 1988. The 250 Gripen aircraft built are flying in Sweden, Czech Republic, Hungary, Brazil, South Africa and Thailand. The company has offered its latest variant, Saab Gripen NG, to India. The aircraft has been sourced roughly 67 per cent from Swedish or European suppliers and 33 per cent from the US. All operators have access to the Gripen’s source code and technical documentation, allowing for upgrades and new equipment to be independently integrated. NG (Next Generation) version on offer to India can be fitted with the more powerful power-plant (EJ-200), have new avionics and AESA radar. An Electronic Warfare (EW) version of the Gripen F two-seater is under development. \nThe Swedish Armed Forces plan to maintain 100 C/D-model aircraft until 2042. The first Gripen E was rolled out on May 18, 2016. SAAB proposed significant transfer of technology and to make India an ‘independent manufacturer’ of the fighter jets. \nSAAB has tied with the Adani group as their production partner in India. The proposal has the backing of the Swedish government. \nIndia’s LCA Tejas This indigenous single engine aircraft is meant to replace the large number of MiG-21 Squadrons which are on their way out. \nThe LCA Tejas is the first major modern fighter aircraft building project after the HF-24. For India to emerge as a significant aircraft producer, which is precursor for becoming a global power, the LCA programme must not only succeed but it must become a launch pad for the indigenous Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). \nOnly six LCA Mk1 aircraft have been delivered to the IAF till date. The first Squadron will get its full numbers only in late 2019. The aircraft is flying under Initial Operational Clearance (IOC) and the Final Operational Clearance (FOC) is awaited. \nHAL, which is the main integrator of the aircraft, is now responsible for its further Design & Development and plans to deliver more than 300 Tejas variants to IAF over the coming years, with a promise to meet all IAF specifications and requirements. \nAMCA The Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft is planned to be India’s own futuristic aircraft with some 5th generation capabilities like stealth and technology.

But the talks seem to be stuck on funding and work share. \nMeanwhile, there are reports from Washington indicating the US Government’s willingness to sell its latest F-35 Fifth Generation Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) to India. \nIt is authoritatively learnt however that neither side has made any official request either to buy or sell it. There have been discussions in some US Think Tanks and Congress though that it should be sold to India even if New Delhi has not been a partner in its development programme like other countries that include, for instance, Britain, Japan, Australia, South Korea, Israel and Italy. \nThere is great diplomatic goodwill at the highest levels between New Delhi and Washington now, and acquisition of this most modern high technology aircraft could give IAF the proverbial Advantage of Late Start. \nIf India has to ask, it is time perhaps to do that now. \n– with inputs from Gulshan Luthra Email* Indian Army Strikes Terrorist Camps in POK \nNew Delhi.

She said it was imperative that innovation be cultivated within the country to achieve the goal of self-reliance in defence. \nSince the 1990s, the service sector had grown exponentially with very little support from the government. The focus was on reviving manufacturing with the aim to equip the armed forces with advanced equipment. \n‘Policies simplified’ \nThe government had opened up investment and simplified and streamlined the government’s policies in 2016. “We made it a point to identify Indian manufacturers,” she said adding that typically it took a decade to develop a product from research laboratory to launching it. \nThe interaction with the Minister was organised by the students of the Indian Institute of Technology as part of their extra mural lecture series. \nMs. Sitharaman later took questions from the students, most of which revolved around Defence Research and Development Organisation and whether it had stopped recruiting students and if it was involved actively in R&D activities. Students also wanted to know why Tamil Nadu was chosen to hold the defence expo. \nThe Minister said recruitment had not been stopped and that the organisation was extremely active. She said some of the new equipment that would be on display at the exposition would be the pride of India when put to use. \nMs. Sitharaman said Tamil Nadu was chosen as it was already a hub of industrial activity and the industry could provide opportunities or employment.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T23:43:55.000+03:00', 'uuid': '321bdb73e091f11e5c5feff621dbcc2523e45e0d', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T22:32:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': '‘T.N.’s industry background ideal for defence corridor’', 'site': 'thehindu.com', 'main_image': 'http://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg', 'domain_rank': 806, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': '‘T.N.’s industry background ideal for defence corridor’', 'uuid': '321bdb73e091f11e5c5feff621dbcc2523e45e0d', 'site_section': 'http://www.thehindu.com/?service=rss#', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 1, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 1}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T22:32:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'IN', 'site_full': 'www.thehindu.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdggltjiAzkXfUExY5Ns5BI6AEGeyUa8cj.flGF0NTwOJjiwZozh6.MmPt68ymo_DVj4.baPp7qwys3ja4HzgrB4Crd_MR12KBb7I.BDDH6vt.n_wuGrimhqrwmPZyNUWH', 'section_title': 'The Hindu - Home'}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'tamil nadu', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 't.n.', 'sentiment': 'negative'}, {'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'nirmala sitharaman', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'state', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'indian institute of technology-madras', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'anna university', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YBD4zSwJdl2k_EbfTSBpdggltjiAzkXfUExY5Ns5BI6AEGeyUa8cj.flGF0NTwOJjiwZozh6.MmPt68ymo_DVj4.baPp7qwys3ja4HzgrB4Crd_MR12KBb7I.BDDH6vt.n_wuGrimhqrwmPZyNUWH', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'Special Correspondent', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Nirmala reviews preparations for DefExpo', 'text': 'April 09, 2018 01:01 IST Updated: April 09, 2018 17:24 IST more-in Dry run of demonstrations of land, air and naval systems held; export-worthy products made by India to be showcased at event \nDefence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday reviewed the preparations for the upcoming DefExpo 2018 to be held at Thiruvidanthai, on the East Coast Road, from April 11–14. \nA dry run of the demonstrations of the land, air and naval systems, scheduled to be displayed for Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 12, was conducted in her presence. \nThe Prime Minister would officially inaugurate the event that day, and would open the ‘India Pavilion,’ spread over 35,000 sq.ft, which would showcase the latest products made by public and private companies. \n“This defence expo, will showcase, a number of products that are being made by India and can be exported.

The park has been set up at a cost of Rs 99.96 crore and will benefit around 25,000 farmers in this as well as neighbouring states. Harsimrat said the Central Government was committed to uplift the status of farmers in the country. She said the mega food park on 50.14 acre had a central processing centre as well as three primary processing centres at Ram Nagar, Ramgarh and Kaladungi. “The park will not only benefit farmers of Udham Singh Nagar, but also those of nearby districts of Nainital, Pauri Garhwal, Almora and Champawat’’, said Harsimrat Badal. She said the food processing sector would contribute towards doubling farmers’ income in the coming years by working to achieve this goal through the implementation of projects under the flagship scheme of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana. The Union minister said the mega food park would leverage an additional investment of about Rs 250 crore in 25 to 30 food processing units and would eventually lead to a turnover of about Rs 450-Rs 500 crore annually. “The park will also provide direct and indirect employment to 5,000 persons and benefit about 25,000 farmers”, she added. The minister said modern infrastructure at the park would benefit farmers, growers, processors and consumers of the state and adjoining areas and prove to be a big boost to the growth of the food processing sector in Uttarakhand.

Next month, he flies to China’s eastern tip, just across the Yellow Sea from South Korea, for a summit of heads of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member countries. After logging this roundtrip of 8,000 km to China in June, PM Modi will make a gruelling visit to Johannesburg in July to participate in the BRICS heads of government summit. But the diplomatic thunder among all of the Prime Minister’s peregrinations this summer will certainly be stolen by the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit beginning next week. All its elements are bound to tug at our heartstrings. The nostalgia of the Raj will sweep over us as the British will lay thick to make up for their post-Brexit isolation in Europe while PM Narendra Modi is expected to be in his elements as he serenades a responsive crowd of Indian expatriates in London. The SCO and BRICS summits on the other hand will be a blip on this year’s diplomatic calendar. Qingdao and Johannesburg anyway are hardly metropolises we relate with. They will be remembered, if at all, for providing the setting for PM Modi’s bilaterals with the Chinese President and, possibly, the Pakistani PM. Admittedly, both the regional organisations sit lightly in the consciousness of India’s strategic elite. On occasions, especially when there is need to demonstrate greater closeness to the West, South Block has feigned frostiness towards them. The times have changed and the Indian foreign policy ship is now facing the challenge of charting through unprecedented unpredictability in relations between major powers. In simple terms, all options have to be on the table and no permutation can be rejected at a time when a major power is a friend one moment and foe the other. Diplomatic ties with the West have been easier to build after the end of the Cold War. The ballast was provided by the common linkages of language, trade, immigration, commonality of interests among the elite and shared administrative systems during colonialism. As India continues to lift itself from poverty, it cannot depend on these powers to help level the international playing field for the third world. BRICS has already erected an alternative to the World Bank and the IMF. The BRICS-owned New Development Bank (NDB) is today an object of wonder and envy among other developing peers. And it has already swung into action by providing a leg up to India’s “Act East” policy by meeting 80 per cent of the cost for a bridge over the Brahmaputra. Another major NDB project is to upgrade 1,500 km of major district roads in Madhya Pradesh. The composition of BRICS — India, China and Russia from Eurasia, and Brazil and South Africa from two other continents — reflects today’s reality of wider diffusion of power in the international system. This even geopolitical spread of its members on the world map positions BRICS as an important springboard to persuade other countries to join hands to push for global financial reform as well as provide a concerted push back to efforts to marginalise the WTO. Now that BRICS has gone past the stage of pious promises, India needs to take the initiative in trimming its flab. BRICS has to shed a host of ancillary activities it had taken upon itself during the initial years and bring the focus on economy and finance even though China and Russia will be tempted to use the forum to settle political scores with the US. The SCO meeting that precedes the BRICS summit will be where the India and Pakistani Premiers are certain to share the stage. But India had bought into the usefulness of SCO long back. Both India and Pakistan had long back signed up for its regional anti-terrorist structure (RATS). Though the mainstream media narrative is transfixed by the US heavy-lifting to keep in check the Indian bête noire Hafiz Saeed, the real threat may be incubating in what is known as the “Crescent of Instability”: the highlands of Central Asia, the mountains of Caucasus and Afghanistan whose fighters have fluidly moved from one theatre of conflict to another. In the past, fighters from the former Soviet Union provided some of the toughest and more determined resistance on Pakistan’s borders and in Afghanistan. Tahir Yuldashev-led Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan had kept an entire Pakistani army battalion at bay, killing about 170 soldiers and permitting the Commanding Officer to get away after village elders intervened. Yuldashev’s predecessor, Jumma Namangani, was a source of strength for the Taliban government and his fighters were instrumental in the escape of Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden to Pakistan. SCO’s RATS, which has inputs from governments located in the “Crescent of Instability” will be invaluable for Indian security planners in identifying future matrix of threats, inspiration and training grounds. But Russia and China will be interested in giving it a political-military orientation because of their difficulties with the West. The screws are tightening on Moscow and Washington could even sanction Russian arms exports. India has to tread a delicate line because of its strategic alignment with the US on the right to freedom of navigation in the Indo-Pacific. The State Department is disorientated and distracted because of the change of guard at the top and the paucity of diplomatic resources: a quarter of US ambassadorships and eight of the top US State Department posts are vacant. India’s trade relationship with the US is not holding up too well, neither is the strategic proximity yielding immediate dividends except to whet the American appetite to unload more arms on India. US diplomacy is currently not in the right shape to sustain its earlier scrutiny and persuasion of potential allies who might be gravitating to the “enemy” camp. This might be the right opportunity for PM Modi to invest more vigour in BRICS and SCO even though China will remain slotted in the frenemy category. Indian participation in both these bodies will open up locked up trade routes and diversify its energy imports with oil and gas pipelines. The lessons of economic integration in North America, China-Eurasia and the EU, where conflicts have precipitately declined, need to be brought to bear on South Asia that still remains the world’s least integrated area. sandeep4731@gmail.com', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'crawled': '2018-04-08T23:46:08.000+03:00', 'uuid': 'e6dfa1b8d8ae0eed8c1226a36b1a6d9e210df2b8', 'rating': None, 'published': '2018-04-08T19:41:00.000+03:00', 'ord_in_thread': 0, 'thread': {'title_full': 'Promise of unusual friendships', 'site': 'tribuneindia.com', 'main_image': 'http://images.tribuneindia.com/cms/gall_content/2018/4/2018_4$largeimg09_Monday_2018_003934368.jpg', 'domain_rank': 14236, 'site_type': 'news', 'title': 'Promise of unusual friendships', 'uuid': 'e6dfa1b8d8ae0eed8c1226a36b1a6d9e210df2b8', 'site_section': 'http://www.tribuneindia.com/', 'participants_count': 1, 'social': {'stumbledupon': {'shares': 0}, 'gplus': {'shares': 0}, 'vk': {'shares': 0}, 'linkedin': {'shares': 0}, 'facebook': {'shares': 0, 'comments': 0, 'likes': 0}, 'pinterest': {'shares': 0}}, 'site_categories': ['media'], 'published': '2018-04-08T19:41:00.000+03:00', 'country': 'SG', 'site_full': 'www.tribuneindia.com', 'performance_score': 0, 'replies_count': 0, 'spam_score': 0.0, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_6t5KmapPf.DpRc7O053XOA6LFL40UnSEi8V5NaVPmroFIChiNEF.dn5c5tVS_SjsJrpCyJZ_qFc_awxzLFkLrUGlU8umaLcW9BaJEiS9i9Q--', 'section_title': 'The Tribune, Chandigarh, India : Latest news, India, Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, J&amp;K, sports, cricket '}, 'entities': {'locations': [{'name': 'south korea', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'qingdao', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'china', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'johannesburg', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'europe', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'london', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'yellow sea', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'persons': [{'name': 'narendra modi', 'sentiment': 'positive'}, {'name': 'sandeep dikshit', 'sentiment': 'positive'}, {'name': 'modi', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'raj', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'brics', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'shanghai cooperation organisation', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'sco', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'url': 'http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_6t5KmapPf.DpRc7O053XOA6LFL40UnSEi8V5NaVPmroFIChiNEF.dn5c5tVS_SjsJrpCyJZ_qFc_awxzLFkLrUGlU8umaLcW9BaJEiS9i9Q--', 'language': 'english'}, {'author': 'Indian Embassy organises conclave of Yoga organisations', 'external_links': [], 'title': 'Indian Embassy organises conclave of Yoga organisations', 'text': 'Indian Embassy organises conclave of Yoga organisations \nMuscat: A “Conclave of Yoga Organisations” was organised by the Embassy of India here on April 6 at its auditorium.The event was a curtain raiser to the 4th International Day of Yoga, which will be celebrated on June 21, 2018.

The BJP\'s charge was that the matter was being politicised as Prime Minister Narendra Modi came from a poor family and the BJP had largest number of Dalit and tribal MPs and MLAs in its fold. \nPrasad claimed that the maximum violence was seen in those parts of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where the Congress and the BSP had influence. \nOpposition parties were trying to spread bitterness, casteism and regionalism in the country to target the BJP, he alleged. \nGehlot said the Narendra Modi-led government had strengthened the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act with amendments in 2016 and done a lot to celebrate Ambedkar\'s legacy, including observing his birth anniversary with year-long events and building memorials in places linked to him. \nCiting Gandhi\'s reported comments that the act had been abrogated, Prasad alleged that he was fuelling the fire with his lies. \nTo a question about Gandhi\'s planned fast, he said that the Congress leader had a right to do so but should refrain from spreading rumours. \nGehlot said Modi had been able to make his image of a "messiah" for weaker sections of the society, causing heartburn in the opposition. \nParties like the Congress and the BSP did nothing for Dalits and at times even worked against their interests, Prasad and Gehlot alleged. \nIt was Mayawati who as the Uttar Pradesh chief minister in 2007 wrote to the state police to stop misuse of the act while the Congress did not accord Bharat Ratna to Ambedkar for decades following his death in 1956, Prasad claimed. \nTaking a dig at the Congress, he said the party had now discovered love for Ambedkar. \nCiting the government\'s work to empower Dalits, Gehlot said the BJP was the only pro-Dalit party. B JP\'s Dalit MPs have exposed \'anti-Dalit\' Modi govt: Congress \nDubbing the Union government as "anti-Dalit," the Congress has said its criticism by Bharatiya Janata Party\'s Dalits MPs has exposed it and asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to break his "silence" and respond to their concerns. \nQuoting from the statements five BJP Dalit MPs, Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill claimed that they proved Modi was working to make India \'Dalit-mukt.\' \nThe condition of scheduled castes can be understood when even the ruling party\'s MPs were underlining their fear and concerns, he told reporters. \nTaking a dig at Modi\'s 2014 poll campaign around \'Chai pe charcha\' and his monthly radio broadcast \'Mann ki Baat,\' the Congress spokesperson asked the prime minister to engage in a \'charcha\' (discussion) with his own party\'s Dalit MPs to listen to their \'Mann ki Baat\'. \nHe said the situation due to rising atrocities on Dalits amid the government\'s lack of concern and inaction over the malady has reached such an alarming level that even the BJP MPs were now saying that the Modi government has done nothing for the community and that their condition has deteriorated under the government. \n"The prime minister must break his never-ending silence on rising atrocities against Dalits and respond to the concerns and questions of his own MPs. BJP MPs\' statements prove beyond doubt that PM Modi was working towards a ‘Dalit-mukt\' India," Shergill said. \nBJP MPs have exposed Modi\'s "anti-Dalit" mindset and policies, he added. \nTaking a dig at the Prime Minister\'s directive to his party MPs to spend a night in a village with over 50 per cent Dalits and tribals population, he said the prime minister should first call his party\'s Dalit MPs to his house to address their concerns rather than doing these "PR stunts". \nThe statements of BJP\'s Dalit MPs -- Udit Raj, Savitri Bai Phule, Chhote Lal Kharwar, Ashok Kumar Dohre and Yashwant Singh -- have punctured the government\'s tall claims, he said. \nThese Lok Sabha members have expressed concerns over issues facing Dalits. While some of the MPs like Udit Raj and Dohre have not targeted their party\'s top brass outright others like Singh and Phule have been explicit in their criticism of the government. \nModi\'s "stoic silence" shows the BJP-RSS is working towards making India Dalit-free and he was "enjoying" the anguish and pain of the scheduled castes and tribes, Shergill alleged.
