      "text": "CHANDIGARH: Setting a new high, two MBA students of University Buisness School ( UBS ), Panjab University , have bagged the highest pay package of Rs 46 lakh per annum. Tolaram group, which has operations in six countries, has offered the highest salary package.\nRenuka Negi, 25, one of the students who has received the highest package, comes from a tribal community of Sangla valley in Kinnaur and wants the youth of her community to explore opportunities outside the valley.\nMoreover, the average salary this year has increased to Rs 9 lakh from last year's Rs 7.58 lakh per annum. The highest stipend for summer internship this year has increased to Rs 60,000 per month. More than 104 students have been placed so far.\n\"This year 45 companies visited us for placements. The job profile offered to students has also improved. Moreover, the stipend for summer placements has also seen remarkable improvement. All this has happened because of several measures taken by us and we plan to improve our NIRF rankings also,\" said Deepak Kapur , chairperson of UBS.\nThe highest package of Rs 15 lakh per annum was offered to three students of UBS in 2016-17. The average package offered was Rs 7.59 lakh per annum. However, in the session 2015-16, seven MBA had bagged the highest package of Rs 21 lakh per annum. In 2014-15, the highest package was Rs 13 lakh per annum.\nUnlike last year, the IT companies including Infosys, TCS, Wipro etc. made a comeback and offered improved salary package to the students.",

      "title": "Ghaziabad Development Authority [GDA] — illegal construction and encroachment in ground floor and inevitable condition for nearby residents",
      "text": "I er. Anil kumar mishra resident of 16/372/3 vasundhara sec-16, ghaziabad wants you to tend your attention towards the below neighbor mr. Sharma, ground floor (16/372/2).\n1) mr. Sharma has encroached towards the road side and laid a shed outside my balcony and is running a commerical insurance office in his below flat. Also he has removed all the supporting walls and changed the structure of gda approved plan., which some day is going to bring the 1st floor resident into severe damage.\n2) in order to complete his buisness requirements he has covered the back side of my flat with air conditioner units and unwanted truss structure which provides him air ventilation below. Creating a severe inevitable condition for me to reside in the above flat.\n3) the front side of the building is covered by his shed and all the dirt gets collected on his shed and block my view to road and nature outside, also creating a unpleasant condition for me to stand even for some time in my balcony, so finally use of balcony goes in vain.\nAll these changes done by mr. Sharma are not justified by gda authorities, but still hes gets some support form the gda personnels who support him as i have been told that making complaints and asking for removal of these encroachments is not going to make mr. Sharma change his mind.\nI. E he is not going to remove any of the changes he has made, and he will not providing any support to building structure beacuse of the changes made in ground floor to settle his buisness.\nI am providing the images which shows the use of gda flat as an commercial land which in result makes unfit condition for me to reside in my flat above.\nI am retired central govt employee and want to settle in my house in ghaziabad now but the condition nearby is not allowing me to do so.\nTherefore i request the authorities to remove all such changes made and ensure that if anything happens wrong, gda will be responsible for any man or material losses in future.\nYours sincerely,\nEr. Anil kumar mishra\nRt. Asst valuation officer, income tax department\nHouse: 16/372/3, vasundhara, ghaziabad\nMob: [protected], [protected]",
